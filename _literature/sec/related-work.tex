%% Discuss types of energy storage and how they are proposed to be used

%% Types: Hydro, compressed air, flywheel, battery etc
%% Application: Grid support (peak shaving), DG uptake (flexibility), economic (arbitrage & market)

%Large scale energy storage solutions like pumped storage hydro-electric have been in used for a long time to provide load levelling and energy reserve functions. In 1982, Wicks et.al. \cite{Wicks1982} proposed a linear programming approach to automatically control such an energy storage solution. This first step was 
%
%The idea of using batteries to support network operation is not new. In 1982, DelMonaco et.al.\cite{DelMonaco1982} highlighted the basic considerations when planning the operation and maintenance of grid connected batteries. They were amongst the first to publicly identify the role of energy storage beside distributed renewable generation, and the associated issues of bidirectional power flow and islanding of isolated branches.
