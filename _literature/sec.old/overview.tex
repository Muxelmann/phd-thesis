Technology advancements and increasing popularity of renewable energy sources, combined with government incentives to support their uptake, also lead to a significant rise in Distributed Energy Resources (DERs).
Yet to allow DERs to be installed without significant negative impact on the local MV or LV networks, required functions that large scale power levelling systems could not provide. More specifically, fast response to counteract highly volatile loads or unpredictable and distributed DERs; e.g. home PV installations \cite{Jewell1987}.
