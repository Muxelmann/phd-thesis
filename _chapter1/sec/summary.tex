\section{Summary}
\label{ch1:sec:summary}

In this chapter, a method to adjust an ESMU schedule to support network operation has been developed and tested.
This ESMU was controlled by a predetermined and underlying schedule, which was a half-hourly dis/charge profile that was tailored for the daily variations in power demand.
Through adjustments of the three-phase active and reactive powers, ESMU could be controlled in such a way that it minimised a set of defined costs.
Here, each defined cost is related to a key network parameter and needed to be minimised.
Minimisation indicates an improvement in the network performance since each cost corresponds to a specific key network parameter that does directly indicate network performance.

The results indicate, that when explicitly focusing on the improvement of certain key network parameters, then the derived cost is reduced in every single case.
Furthermore, for most cost minimisation attempts, different costs were impacted, too (i.e. loss minimisation impacted nearly all other costs).
Using cumulative cost differences it was shown that a net cost reduction could be achieved, when the proposed schedule adjustment method was implemented on top of the standard schedule execution.
This fact is also the supported by the resulting probability density analysis, using the two-paired $t$-test.
Using this test after having preconditioned the data to meet its prerequisites, the initial null hypothesis for this chapter could successfully be disproven.
Therefore, there is strong evidence that adjustments of ESMU schedules on a sub-half-hourly bases have positive impacts on the distribution network's operation.

The main limitation of the proposed method is however the battery's half-hourly schedule.
It dictates the total active power that has to be injected into or absorbed from the distribution network.
Also, this schedule inadvertently dictates the remaining overhead in reactive power that may be compensated for on each phase.
Therefore, the next chapter addresses how the active power schedule may be corrected in real-time.
