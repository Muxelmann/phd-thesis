\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{ch1:sec:results-and-discussion}

In this section, all results are presented and briefly discussed.
Each of the three assessments in this section focuses on improvements in voltage level, improvements in network efficiency (i.e. power quality and network losses), and improvements in resource utilisation.
Hence, only a subset of all results is included, but the complete set of results has been appended to this Thesis in Appendix \ref{appx-a:ch1}.

\subsection{Time Series Analysis}
\label{ch1:subsec:time-series-analysis}

The ESMU's largest impact on network voltage levels can be noticed at the ESMU's PCC.
Consequently, any adjustments to the ESMU powers should become most noticeable, too.
This impact can clearly be observed in Figure \ref{ch1:fig:ts-esmu-voltages}.

\input{_chapter1/fig/ts-esmu-voltages}

In this figure, the \textit{base} and \textit{normal} case's voltage profiles are plotted alongside the \textit{minimisation} case, for which voltage deviation is minimised.
The plot shows that during the night's light load (i.e. from 0:00 to 6:00), ESMU was able to boost its voltage towards the nominal feeder voltage.
This is also the case during the lighter load in the afternoon (i.e. between 12:00-14:00).
But during the rest of the day when network load increases, the ESMU is unable to reduce voltage deviation to match its PCC voltage with the network's nominal substation voltage.
The reason behind this behaviour that the ESMU has allocated its resources to serve for the underlying half-hourly ESMU schedule.
Therefore, the remaining resources that could provide voltage support during periods of low demand become limited during periods of high demand.
Combined with the fact that the LV distribution networks are more resistive than inductive (i.e. unlike HV transmission networks), adjusting only being able to adjust the ESMU's reactive powers to stabilise voltage levels, has an even smaller impact.
Nonetheless, due to some continuous yet small availability of power resource, ESMU is able to boost voltages to some extent at all times. In Figure \ref{ch1:subfig:ts-esmu-voltage-cost}, this can be seen since the associated cost has always been reduced in comparison to the \textit{base} and \textit{normal} cases.

The ability to support voltage levels at the ESMU's PCC is interesting, yet supporting voltage levels at all buses throughout the network is more relevant since some of these buses are linked to customers, for which it is essential to maintain a constant voltage level.
Therefore, the results assess both the highest and lowest voltage level that is recorded throughout the network.

\input{_chapter1/fig/ts-all-voltages}

In Figure \ref{ch1:subfig:ts-all-voltages}, despite no voltage violations taking place due to the already boosted substation voltage, the ESMU's positive impact can be observed.
Here, the difference between highest and lowest voltage in the network is noticeably reduced at all times, and their average voltage is brought closer to a nominal voltage level.
The ESMU's function to support the network in providing more stable voltage levels at customer endpoints is therefore met.
This fact is also supported by the associated cost plot in Figure \ref{ch1:subfig:ts-all-voltages-cost}, where a reduction in cost can be observed at all times.


\input{_chapter1/fig/ts-phase-unbalance}

Beside providing stable voltage levels, power quality should also be upheld to assure that distribution networks operate as efficient as possible.
The first power related parameter that indicates network efficiency is phase unbalance.
In Figure \ref{ch1:subfig:ts-phase-unbalance}, the power value of the highest and lowest loaded corresponding phases is plotted over time.
At all times, the sub-half-hourly adjustments of the ESMU's schedule did reduce the underlying phase imbalance.
This is achieved by redistributing power from the most loaded phase to the least loaded phases; hence utilising the unused capacity of the lighter loaded phases.
As expected, the associated cost has been noticeably lowered in comparison to the \textit{base} and \textit{normal} cases.
It should however be noted, that phase balancing during the morning hours is predominantly achieved by using reactive power injection and absorption.
This can be seen by the similar yet increased phase loadings between 0:00 and 7:00.
Therefore, the tradeoff between adding additional strain onto the network, versus balancing phases has to be taken into account.
One such strain that is being put onto the network, is increased neutral power flow due to phasor misalignment.

\input{_chapter1/fig/ts-neutral-power}

For the results that are plotted in Figure \ref{ch1:fig:ts-neutral-power}, neutral power flow is minimised through the adjustment of ESMU powers.
It can be seen, that for the \textit{normal} case, neutral power is not affected at all.
Reason for this result is the choice of evenly assigning the scheduled ESMU power to all three phases.
Therefore, neither phase unbalance nor loading of the neutral conductor is being taken into account.
For the \textit{minimisation} case however, loading of the neutral conductor is successfully reduced in comparison to both the \textit{normal} and \textit{base} case.

\input{_chapter1/fig/ts-power-factor}

Unlike neutral phase unbalance and neutral loading, power factor on the other hand is impacted just by introducing the half-hourly ESMU schedule, as shown in Figure \ref{ch1:fig:ts-power-factor}.
Whilst the choice of a static power factor for all loads in the \textit{normal} case resulted in a constant power throughout the day, half-hourly ESMU intervention in the \textit{base} case results in a noticeable power factor variation.
This variation is however successfully reduced throughout the entire day for the \textit{minimisation} case, in comparison to the \textit{normal} cases.

\input{_chapter1/fig/ts-losses}

The final parameter that indicates system efficiency are the distribution losses.
Figure \ref{ch1:fig:ts-losses} shows the reduction in distribution losses that were achieved when adjusting the ESMU powers accordingly.
In fact, an additional 6.42\% energy savings is achieved, simply by adjusting the ESMU's power injection and absorption behaviour, when comparing the \textit{base} and \textit{minimisation} cases.
Although this amount of energy may seem negligibly small, these saving can amount to a noticeable level of savings on a national scale, which can potentially benefit the entire power network.
Nonetheless, measuring losses is difficult and costly, which is why attempting to do so will likely outweigh the benefits.

Instead, a better way of relieving stress from the power network is to minimise its assets utilisation by mitigating demand spikes.
Since the ESMU was constraint not to deviate from its underlying half-hourly schedule, only phase related demand differences could be addressed.
Hence the impact of correcting those phase differences is bare noticeable, which can be seen in Figure \ref{ch1:fig:ts-all-line-utilisation}.

\input{_chapter1/fig/ts-all-line-utilisation}

Whilst the \textit{normal} case noticeably lowered some of the daily demand, power spikes after e.g. 9pm were not addressed at all.
Even the \textit{minimisation} case could barely reduce those spikes, due to the constraining half-hourly schedule.
Nonetheless, throughout the entire day, ESMU was still able to reduce line utilisation at the substation level; despite those improvements being relatively small in comparison to the impact in the \textit{normal} case.

\subsection{Difference Analysis}
\label{ch1:subsec:difference-analysis}

In order to gage the whether the is a statistical difference in network performance, a box-plot was generated for each case.
The underlying data for each box-plot is the paired difference between the corresponding case's costs and the associated normal case's costs, i.e. when letting the ESMU operate normally, without adjusting its schedule.
Any positive difference in those costs indicates an improvement to the system's performance, whilst a negative difference would imply a worsening.

Here, the improvements for each individual cost are compared and plotted in Figure \ref{ch1:fig:boxplot-overall-improvements}.
A further set of comparing figures is also included in Appendix Section \ref{appx-a:ch1:additional-difference-analysis}, where the impacts on all costs, when minimising a for only an individual cost are compared.
Instead of including all these figures in the main body of this Thesis, the sum of all costs is computed and included in a table to give a more comprehensive indication of these so called cross-cost improvements.

\input{_chapter1/fig/boxplot-overall-improvements}

In Figure \ref{ch1:fig:boxplot-overall-improvements}, it can be seen that the most significant cost related impact on the network was on the improvement of phase unbalance, neutral power and power factor.
The reason for this noticeably larger impact is that the ESMU can assign its scheduled active power in an arbitrary manner to all three phases, as long as the predetermined half-hourly schedule is followed.
It is this constraint of having to obey the schedule, that limits the impact on all other key network parameters.
Reactive power on the other hand is not directly limited to this constraint, since it is not scheduled as such.
The only limit that applies to the ESMU's reactive power injection capabilities, is the remaining PMU capacities when applying the active powers in order to follow the half-hourly schedule.
Also, unlike active power, reactive power has a smaller impact on the LV network due to its physical property, i.e. being more resistive than inductive.
Nonetheless, all key network parameters were impacted positively when they became subject to their associated cost-function minimisation.

To summarise the aforementioned cross-cost improvements (which are presented in detail in the Appendix, Section \ref{appx-a:ch1:additional-difference-analysis}), all costs are calculated for all minimisation cases, compared against the normal case, and accumulated into a single value.
This value is defined as the ``cumulative cost difference''.
Additionally, the normal case is compared to the base case in a similar manner.
This was done since it is interesting to see how the half-hourly schedule impacted the network.

\input{_chapter1/tab/cost-table}

The cumulative cost differences are tabulated in Table \ref{ch1:tab:cost-table}.
Every improvement in system operation is reflected as a reduction in cost, when compared to the corresponding normal or base case.
Therefore, a positive cumulative cost difference indicates, that over an entire day, the system operation improved in regards to the given cost.
Here, these improvements, i.e. positive cumulative cost differences, have been highlighted.

As expected, all entries along the diagonal, i.e. where the evaluated cost is also the cost that was minimised for the underlying case, nearly always show the largest cumulative cost differences.
It is also interesting to see, how a specific cost minimisation had noticeable impacts on different cumulative cost measures.
For example, adjusting the ESMU schedule to achieve the largest reduction in distribution losses (i.e. far right column) had an impact on all key network parameters.
This impact was also positive in nature for all key network parameters (apart from substation voltage deviation).

Then again, although the network optimisation for an optimised line and fuse loading did result in a positive cumulative cost difference, reduction in power factor had a more significant positive impact.
The reason behind this is that instantaneous apparent power contributes to the loading.
This means, that increasing the power factor inadvertently reduces reactive load, which in turn lowers the total current flowing into the system.
Not knowing what cost to address first, makes it difficult for the used solving algorithm to find the global minimum.
To improve the performance of the adjusted ESMU schedule, one could concatenate the cost minimisation in series to locate regions where lower minima may be found.
In this case at least, maximising the network's power factor before addressing fuse and line utilisation would have been a better choice.

\subsection{Probability Density Analysis}
\label{ch1:subsec:probability-density-analysis}

The final part of analysing the results is to statistically determine, whether the cumulative cost differences are indeed significantly different.
To do so, the probability density functions (PDF) of the  cost differences is analysed using a null hypothesis test.
However, the underlying data had to be conditioned in order to meet all prerequisites that are necessary to perform a null hypothesis test, such as the standard $t$-test.
These prerequisites include stationarity, low auto-correlation and high gaussianity of the underlying time-series.
The conditioning to meet such these prerequisites had to be carried out without falsifying the data, therefore limiting possible operations to time-series division and linear transformations.
Details on the exact steps are outside the scope of this chapter, yet have been included in the appendix for completeness.

\input{_chapter1/tab/t-test-table}

Table \ref{ch1:tab:t-test-table} presents the results from this analysis.
Here, $p$-values have been tabulated and those cells with a value below $0.05$ are highlighted in blue.
A similar pattern to that in the previous table seen, where the cumulative cost difference was tabulated.
Here however, instead of just comparing costs, statistical indications to support the significance of the findings is presented, here.
In combination with the preceding table, one can determine that e.g. the impact of optimising operation based on maximum voltage deviation has little to no significant impact on improvements in power factor.
The most critical finding is however, that each cost minimisation did indeed result in significant improvement of corresponding network operation.
