## Progress overview

The thesis is **done**! Chapters 1 through 6 have been reviewed by my supervisors Ben and William. Although the conclusion has not yet been reviewed, I feel confident that it's ok.

The viva is over and I passed with **minor corrections**. Now These corrections need to be applied according to the documents in the [`README/post-viva`](https://github.com/Muxelmann/phd-thesis/tree/master/README/post-viva) directory. My plan is to finish all corrections by the 22nd of June 2018, to still graduate in July 2018.

**UPDATE: It appears as if there is more to do that I hoped for.**
4 week after having sending the complete corrections (or 5 weeks when counting from the day when I sent the corrections of chapters 1-6), I received a reply from my Examiner. The issues being raised were:

- there are too many spelling errors
- there is too much equivocation
- the paragraph structure is not making it easy on him

Therefore, I spent the past days re-writing chapter 7 (again) and having it proofread by Timur (following further amendments). Tomorrow, on 10th of June, I will prepare the response to my Examiner and send it first thing on Monday.

## Correction progress

1. Received corrections - `24 April 2018`
    - Identify scope of added discussions and corrections
    - Prepare response to internal examiner with intended changes
    - Assure scope will satisfy examiner **before** applying corrections

2.	Finished contribution chapters - `30 April 2018`
	- All corrections may be found on in Dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pu362ccrpp9ncmc/thesis%20post-viva%20-%20mzangs%20v1.pdf?dl=0) (_link will expire once thesis is submitted_)
	- The proposed changes to the conclusion/discussion section will be drafted
	- Proof of corrections is included in the [`README/post-viva`](https://github.com/Muxelmann/phd-thesis/tree/master/README/post-viva), too

3. Applied further corrections to chapter 7 - `7 June 2018`
	- I found some mistakes and typos throughout the chapter -> corrected
	- Long sentences in 7.3 and 7.4 are shortened to avoid obscure language
	- Paragraphs relating to the same topic in 7.4 are combined
	- The PDF is backed up on Dropbox **but is still subject to change**

4.	Further proofreading - `8 June 2018`
	- Found several past tense vs present tense mistakes throughout chapter 7. Everything regarding the project is now past tense.
	- Simplified more formulations in Section 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5.
	- *Still awaiting Timur's remarks* (then I'll send it off to my Examiner)

5.	Even more proofreading - `9 June 2018`
	- Applied Timur's comments and read through Chapters 1, 2 and 7 for better clarity.
	- I switched to *fair* instead of *markup* version
	- Tomorrow, I will highlight the relevant sections for my Examiner and send the response email

6. Final corrections (hopefully) - `10 June 2018`
	- I highlighted all paragraphs that were changed noticeably (neglecting "*e.g.*" and smaller smaller typos)
	- The conclusion is reworked as demanded by my Examiner
	- All in all, I addressed the main criticism as best as I could (especially regarding Chapter 7):
		- there are too many spelling errors
		- there is too much equivocation
		- the paragraph structure is not easy to follow
	- Tomorrow I will sent the response email.
