## Progress overview

The thesis is **done**! Chapters 1 through 6 have been reviewed by my supervisors Ben and William. Although the conclusion has not yet been reviewed, I feel confident that it's ok.

The viva is over and I passed with **minor corrections**. Now These corrections need to be applied according to the documents in the [`README/post-viva`](https://github.com/Muxelmann/phd-thesis/tree/master/README/post-viva) directory. My plan is to finish all corrections by the 22nd of June 2018, to still graduate in July 2018.

**UPDATE: It appears as if there is more to do that I hoped for.**
4 week after having sending the complete corrections (or 5 weeks when counting from the day when I sent the corrections of chapters 1-6), I received a reply from my Examiner. The issues being raised were:

- there are too many spelling errors
- there is too much equivocation
- the paragraph structure is not making it easy on him

Therefore, I spent the past days re-writing chapter 7 (again) and having it proofread by Timur (following further amendments). Tomorrow, on 10th of June, I will prepare the response to my Examiner and send it first thing on Monday.

**PERSONAL NOTE:** I feel very pessimistic about the chance of graduating this summer. Following my Examiner's last email, I doubt he will be able to finish all corrections in time. I don't blame him, he is probably busy with marking and university work and sticks to his hard deadline. I am more frustrated about the timing as a whole.

After all, according to my University's own [guidelines](http://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/graduateschool/pgrexaminersguidephd.pdf), a viva *should normally be held within four calendar months of the submission of the thesis*, but it took us 4 months and 1 week. That's not too bad I suppose. However, *if* my viva had been scheduled 3-4 weeks earlier, then I would not have this deadline issue and there would not be any fear regarding this summer graduation.

My hard deadline for finishing corrections is the 20th of July, by which we will certainly finish all corrections (according to my Examiner). But the deadline for submitting the thesis for ratification by senate in order to graduate is the 22nd of June. This means that I'm asking my Examiner to do 3 months worth of work in 2 months. That's quite an ambitious demand and I'm thankful he's doing his best.

Nonetheless, it is so frustrating that (despite my best efforts) my 3.4-year PhD comes down to 3-4 weeks of unfortunate timing. In the end, *if* it all works out, then I'll be laughing, but *if* it doesn't, then I'll have another 6 months to be upset. I'll leave it at that...

## Correction progress

1. Received corrections - `24 April 2018`
    - Identify scope of added discussions and corrections
    - Prepare response to internal examiner with intended changes
    - Assure scope will satisfy examiner **before** applying corrections

2.	Finished contribution chapters - `30 April 2018`
	- All corrections may be found on in Dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pu362ccrpp9ncmc/thesis%20post-viva%20-%20mzangs%20v1.pdf?dl=0) (_link will expire once thesis is submitted_)
	- The proposed changes to the conclusion/discussion section will be drafted
	- Proof of corrections is included in the [`README/post-viva`](https://github.com/Muxelmann/phd-thesis/tree/master/README/post-viva), too

3. Applied further corrections to chapter 7 - `7 June 2018`
	- I found some mistakes and typos throughout the chapter -> corrected
	- Long sentences in 7.3 and 7.4 are shortened to avoid obscure language
	- Paragraphs relating to the same topic in 7.4 are combined
	- The PDF is backed up on Dropbox **but is still subject to change**

4.	Further proofreading - `8 June 2018`
	- Found several past tense vs present tense mistakes throughout chapter 7. Everything regarding the project is now past tense.
	- Simplified more formulations in Section 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5.
	- *Still awaiting Timur's remarks* (then I'll send it off to my Examiner)

5.	Even more proofreading - `9 June 2018`
	- Applied Timur's comments and read through Chapters 1, 2 and 7 for better clarity.
	- I switched to *fair* instead of *markup* version
	- Tomorrow, I will highlight the relevant sections for my Examiner and send the response email
