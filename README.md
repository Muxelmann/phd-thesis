## Progress overview

The thesis is **done**! Chapters 1 through 6 have been reviewed by my supervisors Ben and William. Although the conclusion has not yet been reviewed, I feel confident that it's ok.

The next step, before submission, is to proofread the current copy and then send the final draft to Ben and William for one last check.
