## Progress overview

The thesis is **done**! Chapters 1 through 6 have been reviewed by my supervisors Ben and William. Although the conclusion has not yet been reviewed, I feel confident that it's ok.

The viva is over and I passed with **minor corrections**. Now These corrections need to be applied according to the documents in the [`README/post-viva`](https://github.com/Muxelmann/phd-thesis/tree/master/README/post-viva) directory. My plan is to finish all corrections by the 22nd of June 2018, to still graduate in July 2018.

## Correction progress

1. Received corrections - `24 April 2018`
    - Identify scope of added discussions and corrections
    - Prepare response to internal examiner with intended changes
    - Assure scope will satisfy examiner **before** applying corrections

2.	Finished contribution chapters - `30 April 2018`
	- All corrections may be found on in Dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pu362ccrpp9ncmc/thesis%20post-viva%20-%20mzangs%20v1.pdf?dl=0) (_link will expire once thesis is submitted_)
	- The proposed changes to the conclusion/discussion section will be drafted
	- Proof of corrections is included in the [`README/post-viva`](https://github.com/Muxelmann/phd-thesis/tree/master/README/post-viva), too

3. Applied further corrections to chapter 7 - `7 June 2018`
	- I found some mistakes and typos throughout the chapter -> corrected
	- Long sentences in 7.3 and 7.4 are shortened to avoid obscure language
	- Paragraphs relating to the same topic in 7.4 are combined
	- The PDF is backed up on Dropbox **but is still subject to change**
