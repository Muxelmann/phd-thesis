\section{Overview of Main Findings}
\label{ch-conclusion:main-findings}

This thesis' problem statement, which has been presented in Chapter~\ref{ch-introduction}, can be summarised as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	The aim of this thesis is to investigate how BESS in the LV network should be controlled in order to achieve best possible network support, including the reduction of peak load, voltage deviations and phase balance.
	\item 
	To assess the impact of BESS on the LV network's topology, simulations are being run to compare on-line and off-line control performance.
	\item
	Given that BESS can operate flexibly but have a limited energy resource and often have a predetermined half-hourly schedule, the research studies whether sub-half-hourly corrections can improve the performance of LV networks by incorporating load forecasts.
\end{itemize}

The reviewed literature in Chapter~\ref{ch-literature} as well as the findings from Chapter~\ref{ch1} emphasise the need for improved methods of control for energy storage in the LV network.
