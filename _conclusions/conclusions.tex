\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{ch-conclusions}

The aim of this thesis was to present the development of novel control methods for Battery Energy Storage Solutions (BESS) that aid Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) in improving the operation and reliance of their Low-Voltage (LV) networks.
Throughout this thesis, aspects concerning the scheduling and control of energy storage devices on the LV network for system support have been studied and each chapter has presented its own findings and conclusions.
From the results and findings of each chapter, this thesis presents several contributions to knowledge.
Therefore, this chapter, Chapter~\ref{ch-conclusions}, is going to retrospectively summarise those contributions to knowledge and link them back to the overarching problem statement presented in Section~\ref{ch-introduction:sec:problem-statement}.
At first, the main findings are summarised in Section~\ref{ch-conclusions:sec:main-findings}.
Then, the contributions to knowledge are presented in Section~\ref{ch-conclusions:sec:knowledge-contribution}, before the limitations of the conducted research and the potential future work are discussed in Section~\ref{ch-conclusions:sec:research-limits-and-future-work} and a conclusion is draw in Section~\ref{ch-conclusions:sec:conclusion}.
