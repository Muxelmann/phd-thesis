\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch-conclusion}

Throughout this thesis, aspects concerning the scheduling and control of energy storage devices on the LV network for system support have been studied.
More specifically, each chapter has presented its own findings and conclusions, and thus this thesis presents several contributions to knowledge.
Therefore, this chapter, Chapter~\ref{ch-conclusion}, is going to retrospectively summarise to those contributions to knowledge and link them back to the overarching problem statement presented in Section~\ref{ch-introduction:sec:problem-statement}.
At first, Chapter~\ref{ch-conclusion} summarises the main findings in Section~\ref{ch-conclusion:main-findings}.
Then, the contributions to knowledge are presented in Section~\ref{ch-conclusion:knowledge-contribution}, before the limitations of the conducted research and the potential future work are, respectively, being discussed in Section~\ref{ch-conclusion:research-limits} and Section~\ref{ch-conclusion:future-work}.
