\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{ch-conclusions}

The aim of this thesis was to present the development of novel control methods for Battery Energy Storage Solutions (BESS) that aid Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) in improving the operation and reliance of their Low-Voltage (LV) networks.
Throughout this thesis, methods have been developed and studied that concern the scheduling and control of energy storage in the LV network.
Each contribution chapter of this thesis thus built upon the outlined gaps in literature (i.e. presented in Section~\ref{ch-literature:sec:literature-gaps}), developed control methods, presented its findings and drew conclusions upon those.
From the collection of results and findings of each chapter, this thesis provides several contributions to knowledge.
Therefore, this chapter is going to retrospectively summarise those contributions to knowledge and link them back to the overarching problem statement that was presented in Section~\ref{ch-introduction:sec:problem-statement}.
At first, the main findings are summarised in Section~\ref{ch-conclusions:sec:main-findings}.
Then, the contributions to knowledge are presented in Section~\ref{ch-conclusions:sec:knowledge-contribution}.
The limitations of the conducted research and the potential future work are discussed in Section~\ref{ch-conclusions:sec:future-work} and in the end an overarching conclusion is drawn in Section~\ref{ch-conclusions:sec:conclusion}.
