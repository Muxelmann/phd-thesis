\epigraph{\textit{It is not a dream. It is a simple feat of scientific electrical engineering. Electric power can drive the world's machinery without the need of coal, oil or gas. Although perhaps humanity is not yet sufficiently advanced to be willingly lead by the inventor's keen searching sense. Perhaps it is better in this present world of ours where a revolutionary idea may be hampered in its adolescence. All this that was great in the past was ridiculed, condemned, combatted, suppressed only to emerge all the more triumphantly from the struggle. [...] Our duty is to lay the foundation for those who are to come and to point the way, yes humanity will advance with giant strides. We are whirling through endless space with an inconceivable speed, all around everything is spinning, everything is moving, everywhere there is energy.}}{--- Nicola Tesla}

Beginning the transition of UK energy systems to reach national low-carbon\linebreak
economy targets, is expected to put significant strain onto the existing power\linebreak
networks. Reinforcing the Low-Voltage (LV) distribution network, to assure its\linebreak
operation remains within statutory constraints, will become essential and necessary\linebreak
when, e.g. Low-Carbon Technologies (LCTs) like heat pumps, photovoltaic panels, or\linebreak
Electric Vehicles (EVs) begin penetrating the network. The expected impact,\linebreak
such as higher voltage deviation, phase unbalance, neutral current and larger\linebreak
mean power flow, will make the Distribution Network Operator's (DNO's) role of\linebreak
ensuring their LV networks remain within the aforementioned statutory limits \linebreak
a significant challenge. The deployment of Battery Energy Storage Solution \linebreak
(BESS) is seen as a feasible alternative to conventional network reinforcement.\linebreak
Energy storage control, for both single, DNO owned and multiple, privately owned\linebreak
energy storage devices, to improve LV network operation without the need for any\linebreak
reinforcement, is the main contribution of this thesis.

More specifically, this thesis explores control methods for the unique characteristics of volatile demand profiles at high temporal resolutions.
The novel energy storage control algorithms are designed to incorporate both half-hourly forecasts and sub-half-hourly load volatility in order to take into account both the long term demand trends and its high volatility.
Methods developed throughout this thesis addresses the challenges when controlling a single (i.e. DNO owned) energy store and those challenges that are encountered in a distributed battery systems.
Results show how energy storage can effectively improve network operation, even when the underlying demand forecast was erroneous.
Real-time control algorithms are studied on a time-series and statistical basis to assess the performance of the developed control methods.
For each of the presented contributions, the key objectives of this thesis are met and the comparable storage control techniques in literature are either met or exceeded in performance when subjected to the available datasets.
