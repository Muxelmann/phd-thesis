\epigraph{\textit{It is not a dream. It is a simple feat of scientific electrical engineering. Electric power can drive the world's machinery without the need of coal, oil or gas. Although perhaps humanity is not yet sufficiently advanced to be willingly lead by the inventor's keen searching sense. Perhaps it is better in this present world of ours where a revolutionary idea may be hampered in its adolescence. All this that was great in the past was ridiculed, condemned, combatted, suppressed only to emerge all the more triumphantly from the struggle. [...] Our duty is to lay the foundation for those who are to come and to point the way, yes humanity will advance with giant strides. We are whirling through endless space with an inconceivable speed, all around everything is spinning, everything is moving, everywhere there is energy.}}{--- Nicola Tesla}
