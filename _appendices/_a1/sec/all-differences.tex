\subsection{Additional Difference Analysis}
\label{appx-a:ch1:additional-difference-analysis}

Only the cost differences for the case of actual cost minimisation were compared in Section \ref{ch1:subsec:difference-analysis}.
Therefore, all remaining cost differences have been included in this appended section.
