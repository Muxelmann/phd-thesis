\subsection{Probability Density Analysis}
\label{appx-a:ch1:probability-density-analysis}

The details described in this section address the prerequisites for the performed null hypothesis test in Section \ref{ch1:subsec:probability-density-analysis}.
These steps were beyond the content of the corresponding chapter, yet have been included for completeness sake.
Here, each step to condition the raw data for the $t$-test is explained in detail.

The original data is a highly volatile, non-stationary and has a non-gaussian probability distribution.
