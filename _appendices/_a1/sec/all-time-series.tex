\subsection{Additional Time Series Analysis}
\label{appx-a:ch1:additional-time-series-analysis}

Since the plots in Section \ref{ch1:subsec:time-series-analysis} are averages over a 10 minute moving average window (in order to aid visual representation of the volatile data), the raw and unfiltered data is included for reference in this appended section.
