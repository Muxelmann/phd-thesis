\subsection{Additional Time Series Analysis}
\label{appx-a:ch1:additional-time-series-analysis}

Since the plots in Section \ref{ch1:subsec:time-series-analysis} are averages over a 10 minute moving average window (in order to aid visual representation of the volatile data), the raw and unfiltered data is included for reference in this appended section.

\subsection{Additional Difference Analysis}
\label{appx-a:ch1:additional-difference-analysis}

Only the cost differences for the case of actual cost minimisation were compared in Section \ref{ch1:subsec:difference-analysis}.
Therefore, all remaining cost differences have been included in this appended section.

\subsection{Probability Density Analysis}

The following plots are similar to those presented in \ref{ch1:subsec:probability-density-analysis} and have been included for completeness sake.
