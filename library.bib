abstract = {This paper proposes a distributed control approach to coordinate multiple energy storage units (ESUs) to avoid violation of voltage and thermal constraints, which are some of the main power quality challenges for future distribution networks. ESUs usually are connected to a network through voltage source converters. In this paper, both ESU converters active and reactive power are used to deal with the above mentioned power quality issues. ESUs' reactive power is proposed to be used for voltage support, while the active power is to be utilized in managing network loading. Two typical distribution networks are used to apply the proposed method, and the simulated results are illustrated in this paper to show the effectiveness of this approach.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a multi-agent approach to power system restoration. The proposed system consists of a number of bus agents (BAGS) and a single facilitator agent (FAG). BAG is developed to decide a suboptimal target configuration after a fault occurrence by interacting with other BAGS based on only locally available information, while FAG is to act as a manager in the decision process. The interaction of several simple agents leads to a dynamic system, allowing efficient approximation of a solution. Simulation results have demonstrated that this method is able to reach suboptimal target configurations, which are favorably compared with those obtained by a mathematical programming approach},

@article{VonAppen2014,
abstract = {Local PV storage systems are emerging in Germany as PV feed-in tariffs have dropped below electricity prices for households. These PV storage systems provide the opportunity to increase the local consumption of locally generated PV energy. The so called self-consumption does not imply an explicit benefit for highly PV penetrated distribution grids suffering PV related voltage rises. Hence, this paper introduces several local voltage control strategies using PV storage systems. These strategies focus on adding a voltage control capability to self-consumption strategies through a combination of voltage dependent battery charging, automatic reactive power provision as well as PV power curtailment. Their potential to smooth the grid integration of PV while increasing self-consumption is assessed through grid simulations and an economic evaluation. In conclusion, PV storage systems which are capable of voltage control can improve PV grid integration and provide a benefit to storage system owners.},

abstract = {This paper illustrates how a multiagent system (MAS)-based scheme can be developed for a control/optimization problem. The prototype problem considered is the dispatching of distributed generators on a distribution feeder to provide voltage support. The popular control net protocol (CNP) for MAS has been adopted to facilitate distributed control. This paper illustrates that characterization of the optimal solution is necessary in order to develop a protocol for the MAS to implement. This paper also shows that MAS facilitates a model-free control procedure, as it can monitor the local sensitivities. Test results, based on simulations on a prototype feeder, show that the proposed MAS-based control scheme is very effective in obtaining the solution for the prototype problem. The proposed method needs fast communication among the distributed generators (DGs) in order to assure fast response during emergency conditions. Communication requirements have also been identified in this paper},

abstract = {This paper proposes an operating framework for aggregators of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). First, a minimum-cost load scheduling algorithm is designed, which determines the purchase of energy in the day-ahead market based on the forecast electricity price and PEV power demands. The same algorithm is applicable for negotiating bilateral contracts. Second, a dynamic dispatch algorithm is developed, used for distributing the purchased energy to PEVs on the operating day. Simulation results are used to evaluate the proposed algorithms, and to demonstrate the potential impact of an aggregated PEV fleet on the power system.},

abstract = {Energy management in microgrids is typically formulated as an offline optimization problem for day-ahead scheduling by previous studies. Most of these offline approaches assume perfect forecasting of the renewables, the demands, and the market, which is difficult to achieve in practice. Existing online algorithms, on the other hand, oversimplify the microgrid model by only considering the aggregate supply-demand balance while omitting the underlying power distribution network and the associated power flow and system operational constraints. Consequently, such approaches may result in control decisions that violate the real-world constraints. This paper focuses on developing an online energy management strategy (EMS) for real-time operation of microgrids that takes into account the power flow and system operational constraints on a distribution network. We model the online energy management as a stochastic optimal power flow problem and propose an online EMS based on Lyapunov optimization. The proposed online EMS is subsequently applied to a real-microgrid system. The simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed EMS exceeds a greedy algorithm and is close to an optimal offline algorithm. Lastly, the effect of the underlying network structure on energy management is observed and analyzed.},

abstract = {Local PV storage systems are emerging in Germany as PV feed-in tariffs have dropped below electricity prices for households. These PV storage systems provide the opportunity to increase the local consumption of locally generated PV energy. The so called self-consumption does not imply an explicit benefit for highly PV penetrated distribution grids suffering PV related voltage rises. Hence, this paper introduces several local voltage control strategies using PV storage systems. These strategies focus on adding a voltage control capability to self-consumption strategies through a combination of voltage dependent battery charging, automatic reactive power provision as well as PV power curtailment. Their potential to smooth the grid integration of PV while increasing self-consumption is assessed through grid simulations and an economic evaluation. In conclusion, PV storage systems which are capable of voltage control can improve PV grid integration and provide a benefit to storage system owners.},

By directly taking the instantaneous multiphase voltage and multiphase current as two vectors with multicomponents each, the instantaneous reactive quantity is considered as the 2nd asymmetrical tensor resulting from the outer-product operation of voltage and current vectors. In this way, the so-called zero-phase sequence component problem is solved. With its concise and direct expression, the theory can be applied to any kind of 3-phase systems, and can also be easily extended to any n-phase systems without any additional transformation, in which the instantaneous quantities will have similar properties to those in a steady sinusoidal 3-phase system. So it may find wide application in many fields.},

abstract = {Increasing penetration of distributed renewable energy sources such as PV may lead to voltage rise in the LV distribution networks. When local production exceeds local consumption, this voltage rise may lead to overvoltage, i.e. violation of the EN 50160 standard. A number of solutions have been developed to mitigate the over voltage, thus increasing the hosting capacity of the LV network without violating EN 50160. Equipping a distribution transformer with On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC), can also solve the overvoltage problem in the LV network. A challenge for the OLTC control is to deal with different voltage profiles of downstream lines of the LV network. This paper evaluates a classical OLTC-based control to mitigate the overvoltage problem and analyzes the possible voltage violation at downstream of the LV network in a rural European LV network.1},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a significant increase in renewable energy supplies amid ever growing demand for energy. At the same time, various factors are putting increasing pressure on the electricity grid network. Energy storage (ES) technologies offer great potential for supporting renewable energy and the UK's energy system. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has named storage as one of eight ‘great technologies the UK can be world leaders in', but how can we reach this potential? Storage technologies are able to absorb and release energy when required and provide ancillary power services which help benefit the power system. The storage industry can therefore deliver tremendous benefits for system stability and security of supply as well as helping to decarbonise UK energy supplies. Storage technologies offer flexibility during times of fluctuating energy generation and demand, which make energy storage technologies an important part of a low carbon future network. In addition there are significant economic benefits - if 2GW of energy storage was deployed by 2020 the industry could create jobs for up to 10,000 people in the UK (Strbac, et al., 2012).},

The model was applied to historical data for the Puget Sound Power and Light Company, who did a comparative evaluation of various approaches to forecasting hourly loads, for two years in a row. The results of that evaluation are also presented here. The approach is a multiple regression model, one for each hour of the day (with weekends modelled separately), with a dynamic error structure as well as adaptive adjustments to correct for forecast errors of previous hours. The results show that it has performed extremely well in tightly controlled experiments against a wide range of alternative models. Even when the participants were allowed to revise their models after the first year, many of their models were still unable to equal the performance of the authors' models.},

abstract = {Although the concept of using batteries for lead levelling and peak shaving has been known for decades, only recently have these systems become commercially viable. Changes in the structure of the electric power supply industry have required these companies to seek more cost-effective ways of meeting the needs of their customers. Through experience gained, primarily in the USA, batteries have been shown to provide multiple benefits to electric utilities. Also, lower maintenance batteries, more reliable electrical systems, and the availability of methods to predict costs and benefits have made battery energy-storage systems more attractive. Technology-transfer efforts in the {\{}USA{\}} have resulted in a willingness of electric utilities to install a number of these systems for a variety of tasks, including load levelling, peak shaving, frequency regulation and spinning reserve. Additional systems are being planned for several additional locations for similar applications, plus transmission and distribution deferral and enhanced power quality. In the absence of {\{}US{\}} champions such as the {\{}US{\}} Department of Energy and the Electric Power Research Institute, {\{}ILZRO{\}} is attempting to mount a technology-transfer programme to bring the benefits of battery energy-storage to European power suppliers. As a result of these efforts, a study group on battery energy-storage systems has been established with membership primarily in Germany and Austria. Also, a two-day workshop, prepared by the Electric Power Research Institute was held in Dublin. Participants included representatives of several European power suppliers. As a result, {\{}ESB{\}} National Grid of Ireland has embarked upon a detailed analysis of the costs and benefits of a battery energy-storage system in their network. Plans for the future include continuation of this technology-transfer effort, assistance in the Irish effort, and a possible approach to the European Commission for funding. },

@article{Su2014,
abstract = {As an important component of Smart Grid, advanced plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are drawing much more attention because of their high energy efficiency, low carbon and noise pollution, and low operational cost. Unlike other controllable loads, PEVs can be connected with the distribution system anytime and anywhere according to the customers' preference. The uncertain parameters (e.g., charging time, initial battery state-of-charge, start/end time) associated with PEV charging make it difficult to predict the charging load. Therefore, the inherent uncertainty and variability of the PEV charging load have complicated the operations of distribution systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC)-based power dispatch approach. The proposed objective functions minimize the operational cost while accommodating the PEV charging uncertainty. Case studies are performed on a modified IEEE 37-bus test feeder. The numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed MPC-based power dispatch scheme. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In today's world, there is a continuous global need for more energy which, at the same time, has to be cleaner than the energy produced from the traditional generation technologies. This need has facilitated the increasing penetration of distributed generation (DG) technologies and primarily of renewable energy sources (RES). The extensive use of such energy sources in today's electricity networks can indisputably minimize the threat of global warming and climate change. However, the power output of these energy sources is not as reliable and as easy to adjust to changing demand cycles as the output from the traditional power sources. This disadvantage can only be effectively overcome by the storing of the excess power produced by DG-RES. Therefore, in order for these new sources to become completely reliable as primary sources of energy, energy storage is a crucial factor. In this work, an overview of the current and future energy storage technologies used for electric power applications is carried out. Most of the technologies are in use today while others are still under intensive research and development. A comparison between the various technologies is presented in terms of the most important technological characteristics of each technology. The comparison shows that each storage technology is different in terms of its ideal network application environment and energy storage scale. This means that in order to achieve optimum results, the unique network environment and the specifications of the storage device have to be studied thoroughly, before a decision for the ideal storage technology to be selected is taken. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper, a generalized formulation for intelligent energy management of a microgrid is proposed using artificial intelligence techniques jointly with linear-programming-based multiobjective optimization. The proposed multiobjective intelligent energy management aims to minimize the operation cost and the environmental impact of a microgrid, taking into account its preoperational variables as future availability of renewable energies and load demand (LD). An artificial neural network ensemble is developed to predict 24-h-ahead photovoltaic generation and 1-h-ahead wind power generation and LD. The proposed machine learning is characterized by enhanced learning model and generalization capability. The efficiency of the microgrid operation strongly depends on the battery scheduling process, which cannot be achieved through conventional optimization formulation. In this paper, a fuzzy logic expert system is used for battery scheduling. The proposed approach can handle uncertainties regarding to the fuzzy environment of the overall microgrid operation and the uncertainty related to the forecasted parameters. The results show considerable minimization on operation cost and emission level compared to literature microgrid energy management approaches based on opportunity charging and Heuristic Flowchart (HF) battery management.},

Three such benefits include reducing peak load, providing standby power, and enhancing power quality. These benefits, however, are only realized during peak load or during an outage, events that are infrequent. This paper presents a means of realizing additional benefits by taking advantage of the fluctuating costs of energy in competitive energy markets. An algorithm for optimal charge/discharge scheduling of Community Energy Storage (CES) devices as well as an analysis of several of the key drivers of the optimization are discussed.},

abstract = {Distributed energy storage systems (ESSs) are becoming essential components for the operation of the increasingly complex electricity grid, where dispersed generation is causing power-flows occurring both top-down and bottom-up. Specifically, the combination of ESSs coupled with application-specific control methods can achieve the interdependent objectives of system stakeholders such as the system operator, electrical utilities, retailers, equipment vendors, the government and the electricity customers. The necessity for an accelerated rate of transition to a multi-directional grid arrangement has been exacerbated by the rapid proliferation of distributed renewable energy sources (RESs) that are now price comparable to traditional supply sources. While there are review articles covering ESS technologies and applications as well as the plethora of future advanced grid arrangements that may eventuate, there is none which comprehensively covers individual and aggregated ESS applications and the corresponding benefits, comparing different technology selection methods and providing application-specific controls. Both operational and monetary benefits are identified and critically reviewed from the perspective of the aforementioned stakeholders. Wholesale and retail energy market regimes are also considered for monetisation of the benefits. The control methods that are provided cover both balanced and unbalanced grid conditions. This comprehensive review paper will be of immense value to researchers and practitioners seeking to understand and unpack the aggregated benefits of ESS in the electricity grid.},

abstract = {Electrical power systems are evolving from today's centralized bulk systems to more decentralized systems. Penetrations of renewable energies, such as wind and solar power, significantly increase the level of uncertainty in power systems. Accurate load forecasting becomes more complex, yet more important for management of power systems. Traditional methods for generating point forecasts of load demands cannot properly handle uncertainties in system operations. To quantify potential uncertainties associated with forecasts, this paper implements a neural network (NN)-based method for the construction of prediction intervals (PIs). A newly introduced method, called lower upper bound estimation (LUBE), is applied and extended to develop PIs using NN models. A new problem formulation is proposed, which translates the primary multiobjective problem into a constrained single-objective problem. Compared with the cost function, this new formulation is closer to the primary problem and has fewer parameters. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) integrated with the mutation operator is used to solve the problem. Electrical demands from Singapore and New South Wales (Australia), as well as wind power generation from Capital Wind Farm, are used to validate the PSO-based LUBE method. Comparative results show that the proposed method can construct higher quality PIs for load and wind power generation forecasts in a short time.},

abstract = {An optimization model is proposed to manage a residential microgrid including a charging spot with a vehicle-to-grid system and renewable energy sources. In order to achieve a realistic and convenient management, we take into account: (1) the household load split into three different profiles depending on the characteristics of the elements considered; (2) a realistic approach to owner behavior by introducing the novel concept of range anxiety; (3) the vehicle battery management considering the mobility profile of the owner and (4) different domestic renewable energy sources. We consider the microgrid operated in grid-connected mode. The model is executed one-day-ahead and generates a schedule for all components of the microgrid. The results obtained show daily costs in the range of 2.82 C = to 3.33 C =; the proximity of these values to the actual energy costs for Spanish households validate the modeling. The experimental results of applying the designed managing strategies show daily costs savings of nearly 10{\%}.},

The active power filter is developed, of which the power circuit consists of quadruple voltage-source PWM converters. As the result, interesting compensation characteristics were verified experimentally which could not be obtained by the active power filter based on the conventional reactive power theory.},

abstract = {During the last decades the electric vehicles (EVs) technologies are developing rapidly which may lead to a significant penetration level in the mobility market in the near future. As a consequence of these high penetration levels, power grids, especially on the low voltage level, might face a number of technical problems. These can be transformer and cables overloads, feeder congestions and especially voltage limits violations. Renewables may introduce a solution for part of these problems but not all of them. In order to minimize peak loads caused by charging EVs, intelligent control algorithms for EV charging are needed. This paper focuses on a dynamic co-simulation environment which enables the realistic evaluation of the impact of charging EVs on electrical networks. This co-simulation environment also simulates the behavior of the EV's and estimates the required charging power. In order to test the co-simulation environment a study case is analyzed for a rural residential network with a high penetration of photovoltaic systems.},

@article{Rehman2015,
abstract = {The pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) is a well-established and commercially-acceptable technology for utility-scale electricity storage and has been used since as early as the 1890s. Hydro power is not only a renewable and sustainable energy source, but its flexibility and storage capacity also make it possible to improve grid stability and to support the deployment of other intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. As a result, a renewed interest in PHES and a demand for the rehabilitation of old small hydro power plants are emerging globally. With regard to PHES, advances in turbine design are required to enhance plant performance and flexibility and new strategies for optimizing storage capacity and for maximizing plant profitability in the deregulated energy market. In the early 2000s, this technology has again emerged as an economically and technologically acceptable option for peak load shaving and wind and solar energy storage for power quality assurance. Furthermore, renewable energy sources due to their fluctuating nature cannot maintain or regulate continuous supply of power and hence require bulk electricity storage. The present study aims at reviewing the existing global PHES capacities, technological development, and hybrid systems (wind-hydro, solar pv-hydro, and wind-pv-hydro) and recommending the best possible options. The review explores that PHES is the most suitable technology for small autonomous island grids and massive energy storage, where the energy efficiency of PHES varies in practice between 70{\%} and 80{\%} with some claiming up to 87{\%}. Around the world, PHES size mostly nestles in the range of 1000-1500 MW, being as large as 2000-3000 MW. On the other hand, photovoltaic based pumped storage systems have been used for very small scale (load of few houses) only.},

abstract = {This paper presents the capabilities offered by multiagent system technology in the operation of a microgrid. A microgrid is a new type of power system, which is formed by the interconnection of small, modular generation to low voltage distribution systems. Microgrids can be connected to the main power network or be operated autonomously, similar to power systems of physical islands. The use of MAS technology can solve a number of specific operational problems: the small DG (distributed generation) units have different owners, so centralized control is difficult. Several decisions should be taken locally. Lack of dedicated communication facilities. Microgrids will operate in a liberalized market so the decisions of the controller of each unit concerning the market should have a certain degree of "intelligence". The local DG units besides selling power to the network have also other tasks: producing heat for local installations, keeping the voltage locally at a certain level or providing a backup system for local critical loads in case of a failure of the main system. These tasks reveal the importance of the distributed control and autonomous operation.},

abstract = {Wind farms operating in island systems are subject to output power limitations, related with technical constraints of the conventional generating units, namely the minimum loading levels of the thermal units (technical minima) and a dynamic penetration limit, applied for stability purposes. Evaluation of the expected wind energy yield in isolated island systems requires, therefore, proper consideration, not only of the prevailing wind conditions at the installation site, but also of the power limitations imposed by the system, which ultimately depend on the total load demand. In the paper, a methodology is presented for the evaluation of the wind energy absorption capability of island systems and the expected energy yield of wind farms operating therein. This methodology is currently applied in Greece for the determination of the power restrictions applied to existing and new wind farms, to schedule new wind capacity tenders and for the evaluation of the expected energy yield of new investments for permitting and financing purposes. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Distributed generation often relies upon variable energy sources such as wind and solar. As the adoption of renewable energy increases, this presents a challenge for coordinating the availability of electricity with electrical loads. Energy storage technologies potentially relieve instantaneous imbalances between renewable generation and load demand. Demand response and time-of-use pricing policies are being increasingly adopted as means to further balance generation and demand given constraints on transmission and distribution lines under heavy load conditions. A small scale pilot study was conducted that investigates the interactions of renewable energy sources equipped with battery storage that included utility communication interfacing. Four sites were installed with battery-converter systems with an evaluation that included both commercial and residential applications. The residential applications were equipped with 24 kWh rated battery storage systems with remotely controlled charge and discharge capability. The commercial and light industrial installations were evaluated using 48 kWh battery storage systems. The results using a regional time-of-use pricing structure were analyzed. Results indicate distributed generation with battery storage is positively influenced by demand response and time-of-use pricing.},

abstract = {Increasing the self-consumption of photovoltaic (PV) power is an important aspect to integrate more PV power in the power system. The profit for the PV system owner can increase and the stress on the power grid can be reduced. Previous research in the field has focused on either self-consumption of PV power in individual buildings or PV power curtailment for voltage control. In this paper self-consumption of residential PV power in a community of several single-family houses was investigated using high-resolution irradiance and power consumption data. Cases with individual or shared battery energy storages for the houses were examined. PV power curtailment was investigated as a method to reduce feed-in power to the grid, i.e. peak shaving. Results indicated that the self-consumption ratio increased when using shared instead of individual storage. Reducing the feed-in power from the community by almost 50{\%} only led to maximum 7{\%} yearly production losses due to curtailment and storage losses. The economics for shared storage are slightly better than for individual ones. These results suggest that residential PV-battery systems should use (i) shared energy storage options if local regulations allow it and (ii) PV power curtailment if there are incentives to lower the feed-in power.},

abstract = {This paper presents a solar radiation forecast technique based on fuzzy and neural networks, which aims to achieve a good accuracy at different weather conditions. The accuracy of forecasted solar radiation will affect the power output forecast of grid-connected photovoltaic systems which is important for power system operation and planning. The future sky conditions and temperature information is obtained from National Environment Agency (NEA) and the sky and temperature information will be classified as different fuzzy sets based on fuzzy rules. By using fuzzy logic and neural network together, the forecast results can follow the real values very well under different sky and temperature conditions. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by a case study where four different scenarios are tested. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is much smaller compared with that of the other solar radiation method. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The concern about the complete depletion of fossil fuels along with the negative environmental impact of most of the current energy sources are significant reasons to think of a different way to produce electrical energy and, at the same time, satisfy the necessities for urban mobility. In this context, microgrids (MGs) are power networks which, among other properties, allow more flexible demand consumption, and also help with, the efficient integration of renewable resources and electric vehicles (EVs). However, the effect of the incorporation of EVs has to be taken into consideration with care, since that situation may drive to unfeasible operations in grids which have not been designed to support these particular elements. In this paper, a system composed of different agents is used to develop a market-oriented operation in a MG with several EV charge stations. It is expected that the system takes to an optimal management allowing a technically feasible operation considering the behaviour of every agent involved. The demand shifting and the flexible operation of EVs, spatial and temporal, are features that reduce costs and thus improve the benefit of the participants.},

The inverters which are operated in this way are called static synchronous generators (SSG). This means that the well-established theory/device for synchronous generators can still be used for inverters, which will dominate the power generation in the future because of the increasing share of distributed generation sources and renewable energy sources utilised. The power of an SSG can be regulated using the well-known frequency and voltage drooping mechanism. SSGs can also be easily operated in grid-connected mode or island mode. Simulation results are given to verify the idea.},

abstract = {This paper presents an operational scheme for photovoltaic (PV) inverter reactive power control to accommodate higher levels and leverage efficient use of rooftop PV penetration in distribution systems. The scheme proposes three states of operation with specific operational goals for the PV inverter based on weather conditions and voltage at the interconnection point, and adapts the reactive power control strategy accordingly. In normal state with slowly changing solar irradiance, the control modulates reactive power to reduce power losses. In fluctuating state with rapidly varying solar irradiance due to intermittent passing clouds, the control dynamically changes the reactive power in order to mitigate voltage fluctuations. In contingency state in which the PV terminal voltage violates the nominal operating range, the control adjusts the PV inverter as reactive power sink or source in order to push the voltage back within the range. This paper also proposes a coordination strategy in order to switch control between the states and manage interaction between the fast PV inverter controllers, and the slow on-load tap-changer for voltage regulation. A large-scale distribution network based on the IEEE 37-node test feeder was developed in order to investigate performance of the proposed algorithm.},

A discrete-time model of the storage device reproducing the battery main dynamics (i.e., state of charge, temperature, current, protection, and limitation systems) has been developed. The model has been validated through some experimental tests. An optimal management strategy has been implemented based on a forward dynamic programming algorithm, specifically developed to exploit the energy price arbitrage along the optimization time horizon (generation shifting). Taking advantage of this strategy wind generation performances can be enhanced and adapted to load demand, obtaining an increased economic gain measured by the difference between the economic revenue obtained with and without the proposed generation shifting policy.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new voltage-balancing controller for cascaded multilevel converters, especially for single-phase cascaded multilevel converters. It proposes a control algorithm that devotes itself not only to balancing the floating dc capacitors but also to eliminating the coupling effect between the voltage-balancing controller and the original system controller (controller without additional voltage-balancing controllers). Specifically, the average model in the d-q coordinate frame is derived and the control law is established. Then, the coupling effect between the voltage-balancing controller and the original system controller is identified and a new expression for duty cycle modification is proposed thus to eliminate the effect. Furthermore, this paper gives the design considerations of the pro- posed method, including the derivation of key transfer functions and effective voltage-balancing area, for the completeness of the discussion. Moreover, the reference generation techniques of the voltage-balancing controller are also discussed. This paper investigates the voltage imbalance in the soft-start process caused by an unsuitable reference, and presents a simple modified reference generation solution. Finally, both simulation and experimental results verify the performance of the proposed control system.},

abstract = {Integration of residential-level photovoltaic (PV) power generation and energy storage systems into the smart grid will provide a better way of utilizing renewable power. With dynamic energy pricing models, consumers can use PV-based generation and controllable storage devices for peak shaving on their power demand profile from the grid, and thereby, minimize their electric bill cost. The residential storage controller should possess the ability of forecasting future PV power generation as well as the power consumption profile of the household for better performance. In this paper, novel PV power generation and load power consumption prediction algorithms are presented, which are specifically designed for a residential storage controller. Furthermore, to perform effective storage control based on these predictions, the proposed storage control algorithm is separated into two tiers: the global control tier and the local control tier. The former is performed at decision epochs of a billing period (a month) to globally “plan” the future discharging/charging schemes of the storage system, whereas the latter one is performed more frequently as system operates to dynamically revise the storage control policy in response to the difference between predicted and actual power generation and consumption profiles. The global tier is formulated and solved as a convex optimization problem at each decision epoch, whereas the local tier is analytically solved. Finally, the optimal size of the energy storage module is determined so as to minimize the break-even time of the initial investment in the PV and storage systems.},

abstract = {Modeling electricity storage to address challenges and opportunities of its applications for smart grids requires inter-temporal equalities to keep track of energy content over time. Prevalently, these constraints present crucial modeling elements as to what extent energy storage applications can enhance future electric power systems' sustainability, reliability, and efficiency. This paper presents a novel and improved mixed-integer linear problem (MILP) formulation for energy storage of plug-in (hybrid) electric vehicles (PEVs) for reserves in power system models. It is based on insights from the field of System Dynamics, in which complex interactions between different elements are studied by means of feedback loops as well as stocks, flows and co-flows. Generalized to a multi-bus system, this formulation includes improvements in the energy balance and surpasses shortcomings in the way existing literature deals with reserve constraints. Tested on the IEEE 14-bus system with realistic PEV mobility patterns, the deterministic results show changes in the scheduling of the units, often referred to as unit commitment (UC).},

The reverse power flow due to high penetration of renewable generation may result to voltage rise which distribution network operators (DNOs) may not be able to control effectively. To that effect, this paper therefore reviews the impact of renewable generations such as solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy on distribution system with voltage control strategies. The work reveals that the application of smart grid technologies such as demand side integration (DSI) and energy storage (ES) mitigates voltage variation problems with minimum network reinforcement.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for design and analysis of distributed flocking algorithms. Two cases of flocking in free-space and presence of multiple obstacles are considered. We present three flocking algorithms: two for free-flocking and one for constrained flocking. A comprehensive analysis of the first two algorithms is provided. We demonstrate the first algorithm embodies all three rules of Reynolds. This is a formal approach to extraction of interaction rules that lead to the emergence of collective behavior. We show that the first algorithm generically leads to regular fragmentation, whereas the second and third algorithms both lead to flocking. A systematic method is provided for construction of cost functions (or collective potentials) for flocking. These collective potentials penalize deviation from a class of lattice-shape objects called {\&}alpha;-lattices. We use a multi-species framework for construction of collective potentials that consist of flock-members, or {\&}alpha;-agents, and virtual agents associated with {\&}alpha;-agents called {\&}beta;- and {\&}gamma;-agents. We show that migration of flocks can be performed using a peer-to-peer network of agents, i.e., "flocks need no leaders." A "universal" definition of flocking for particle systems with similarities to Lyapunov stability is given. Several simulation results are provided that demonstrate performing 2-D and 3-D flocking, split/rejoin maneuver, and squeezing maneuver for hundreds of agents using the proposed algorithms.},

To improve the stability and reliability of the system, neural network (NN) self-adaptive PID control algorithm was researched and applied to the system. The controller comprises a back propagation (BP) NN and a radial basis function (RBF) NN. The former is used to adaptively adjust the parameters of the PID controller on line. The later is used to establish nonlinear prediction model and perform parameter prediction. The experimental results show that the NN self-adaptive PID controller is superior to traditional PID controller at response speed, steady-state tracking error and resisting perturbation. Additionally, it can recover more energy, lengthen batteries' life, and increase the driving range than PID controller by 5.3{\%}.},

It firstly uses ARIMA to forecast the daily load, and then uses SVMs, which is known for the great power to learn and generalize, to correct the deviation of former forecasting. Applying this hybrid model to a large sample prediction, the results show that it achieves the forecasting accuracy and has very good prospective in applications.

abstract = {Due to substantial generation and demand fluctuations in standalone green microgrids, energy management strategies are becoming essential for the power sharing and voltage regulation purposes. The classical energy management strategies employ the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms and rely on batteries in case of possible excess or deficit of energy. However, in order to realize constant current-constant voltage (IU) charging regime and increase the life span of batteries, energy management strategies require being more flexible with the power curtailment feature. In this paper, a coordinated and multivariable energy management strategy is proposed that employs a wind turbine and a photovoltaic array of a standalone DC microgrid as controllable generators by adjusting the pitch angle and the switching duty cycles. The proposed strategy is developed as an online nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithm. Applying to a sample standalone dc microgrid, the developed controller realizes the IU regime for charging the battery bank. The variable load demands are also shared accurately between generators in proportion to their ratings. Moreover, the DC bus voltage is regulated within a predefined range, as a design parameter.},

The definitions are consistent with the traditional power definitions and valid for single-phase and polyphase systems, as well as periodic and nonperiodic waveforms. The definitions are applied to a shunt compensation system. The paper elaborates on the compensation of three different cases of nonperiodic current: single-phase disturbance, three-phase subharmonics, and three-phase stochastic current. Simulation results give credibility to the applicability of the definition for a diversity of load currents. According to different compensation cases and the goals to be achieved, different averaging time intervals for the compensator are chosen which will determine the compensator's energy storage requirement and the extent of residual distortion in the source current.},

multi-objective optimization problem for a radial-type distribution
feeder. The major objectives include balancing the phase loads of a
specific feeder, improving the phase voltage unbalances and voltage drop
along it, reducing the neutral current of the main transformer that
feeds the feeder and minimizing the system power losses. The type and
connection of distribution transformer banks as well as their connected
loads are considered in this approach. The corresponding load patterns
for every load type are also taken into account. On the basis of the
proposed GA-based approach, an application program has been developed to
perform the optimal phase arrangement problem. Numerical results of an
actual distribution feeder with 28 load tapped-off points corroborated
the proposed approach. The confirmation was solely through computer

abstract = {High penetration of renewable energy poses a significant challenge in operation of power system. A potential solution for this problem is utilizing Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effectiveness of BESS ability to peak shave and smooth the load curve of an actual circuit on the island of Maui in Hawaii. The distribution circuit has about 850 kW of installed rooftop Photo-Voltaic (PV) generation. Higher penetration of PV increases the concern about the potential impacts on the transmission system. At first, we will present two different methods for load forecasting. Reliable forecasting of daily load is required to effectively utilize the BESS system. We have employed two different methods for load forecasting in order to achieve two main purposes including peak shaving and smoothing. For reaching these goals, two approaches are analyzed. The first approach is utilizing a nonlinear programming method in terms of load shifting and smoothing. The second approach includes a real time control strategy to have smoothing and peak shaving at the same time. As a real case study, these proposed methods have been applied within 108-day data collection period and pros and cons of these methods will be discussed.},

abstract = {Some uncertainties, such as the uncertain output power of a plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) due to its stochastic charging and discharging schedule, that of a wind generation unit due to the stochastic wind speed, and that of a solar generating source due to the stochastic illumination intensity, volatile fuel prices, and future uncertain load growth could lead to some risks in determining the optimal siting and sizing of distributed generators (DGs) in distribution system planning. Given this background, under the chance constrained programming (CCP) framework, a new method is presented to handle these uncertainties in the optimal siting and sizing of DGs. First, a mathematical model of CCP is developed with the minimization of the DGs' investment cost, operating cost, maintenance cost, network loss cost, as well as the capacity adequacy cost as the objective, security limitations as constraints, and the siting and sizing of DGs as optimization variables. Then, a Monte Carlo simulation-embedded genetic-algorithm-based approach is employed to solve the developed CCP model. Finally, the IEEE 37-node test feeder is used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed model and method, and the test results have demonstrated that the voltage profile and power-supply reliability for customers can be significantly improved and the network loss substantially reduced.},

abstract = {Many efforts are recently being dedicated to developing models that seek to provide insights into the techno-economic benefits of battery storage coupled to photovoltaic (PV) generation system. However, not all models consider the operation of the PV – battery storage system with a feed-in tariff (FiT) incentive, different electricity rates and battery storage unit cost. An electricity customer whose electricity demand is supplied by a grid connected PV generation system benefiting from a FiT incentive is simulated in this paper. The system is simulated with the PV modelled as an existing system and the PV modelled as a new system. For a better understanding of the existing PV system with battery storage operation, an optimisation problem was formulated which resulted in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The optimisation model was developed to solve the MILP problem and to analyse the benefits considering different electricity tariffs and battery storage in maximising FiT revenue streams for the existing PV generating system. Real data from a typical residential solar PV owner is used to study the benefit of the battery storage system using half-hourly dataset for a complete year. A sensitivity analysis of the MILP optimisation model was simulated to evaluate the impact of battery storage capacity (kWh) on the objective function. In the second case study, the electricity demand data, solar irradiance, tariff and battery unit cost were used to analyse the effect of battery storage unit cost on the adoption of electricity storage in maximising FiT revenue. In this case, the PV is simulated as a new system using Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM) software tool while modifying the optimisation formulation to include the PV onsite generation and export tariff incentive. The results provide insights on the benefit of battery storage for existing and new PV system benefiting from FiT incentives and under time-varying electricity tariffs.},

@article{Ibrahim2008,
abstract = {Electricity generated from renewable sources, which has shown remarkable growth worldwide, can rarely provide immediate response to demand as these sources do not deliver a regular supply easily adjustable to consumption needs. Thus, the growth of this decentralized production means greater network load stability problems and requires energy storage, generally using lead batteries, as a potential solution. However, lead batteries cannot withstand high cycling rates, nor can they store large amounts of energy in a small volume. That is why other types of storage technologies are being developed and implemented. This has led to the emergence of storage as a crucial element in the management of energy from renewable sources, allowing energy to be released into the grid during peak hours when it is more valuable. The work described in this paper highlights the need to store energy in order to strengthen power networks and maintain load levels. There are various types of storage methods, some of which are already in use, while others are still in development. We have taken a look at the main characteristics of the different electricity storage techniques and their field of application (permanent or portable, long- or short-term storage, maximum power required, etc.). These characteristics will serve to make comparisons in order to determine the most appropriate technique for each type of application. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicles in the future will possibly emerge widely in city areas. Fleets of such vehicles in large numbers could be regarded as considerable stochastic loads in view of the electrical grid. Moreover, they are not stabled in unique positions to define their impact on the grid. Municipal parking lots could be considered as important aggregators letting these vehicles interact with the utility grid in certain positions. A bidirectional power interface in a parking lot could link electric vehicles with the utility grid or any storage and dispersed generation. Such vehicles, depending on their need, could transact power with parking lots. Considering parking lots equipped with power interfaces, in more general terms, parking-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-parking are propose here instead of conventional grid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid concepts. Based on statistical data and adopting general regulations on vehicles (dis)charging, a novel stochastic methodology is presented to estimate total daily impact of vehicles aggregated in parking lots on the grid. Different scenarios of plug-in vehicles' penetration are suggested in this paper and finally, the scenarios are simulated on standard grids that include several parking lots. The results show acceptable penetration level margins in terms of bus voltages and grid power loss.},

A novel control strategy of the distribution reactive power compensation controller is presented in this paper for avoiding the harmonic resonance. Practical and robust control algorithms are proposed for the purpose of easy implementation in a micro-controller. In addition, the controller relies on common low cost sensing devices and does not require additional measurements.

abstract = {In this paper, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used for the performance prediction of large solar systems. The ANN method is used to predict the expected daily energy output for typical operating conditions, as well as the temperature level the storage tank can reach by the end of the daily operation cycle. These are considered as the most important parameters for the user. Experimental measurements from almost one year (226 days) have been used to investigate the ability of ANN to model the energy behavior of a typical large solar system. From the results, it can be concluded that the ANN effectively predicts the daily energy performance of the system; the statistical R2-value obtained for the training and validation data sets was better than 0.95 and 0.96 for the two performance parameters respectively. The data used in the validation were completely unknown to the ANN, which proves the ability of the ANN to give good predictions on completely unknown data. The results obtained from the method were also compared to the input-output model predictions with good accuracy whereas multiple linear regression could not give as accurate results. Additionally, the network was used with various combinations of input parameters and gave results of the same order of magnitude as the suggested method, which prove the robustness of the method. The advantages of the proposed approach include the simplicity in the implementation, even when the characteristics of the system components are not known, as well as the potential to improve the capability of the ANN to predict the performance of the solar system, through the continuous addition of new data collected during the operation of the system. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Many control strategies, such as droop control, master-slave control, and average current-sharing control, have been extensively implemented worldwide to operate parallel-connected inverters for load sharing in DG network. Among these methods, the droop control technique has been widely accepted in the scientific community because of the absence of critical communication links among parallel-connected inverters to coordinate the DG units within a microgrid. Thus, this study highlights the state-of-the-art review of droop control techniques applied currently to coordinate the DG units within a microgrid.},

abstract = {Private households are increasingly taking cooperative action to change their energy consumption patterns in pursuit of green, social, and economic objectives. Cooperative demand response (DR) programs can contribute to these common goals in several ways. To quantify their potential, we use detailed energy consumption and production data collected from 201 households in Austin (Texas) over the year 2014 as well as historic real-time prices from the Austin wholesale market. To simulate cooperative DR, we adapt a load-scheduling algorithm to support both real-time retail prices and a capacity-pricing component (two-part pricing schemes). Our results suggest that cooperative DR results in higher cost savings for households than individual DR. Whereas cooperative DR that is based on real-time pricing alone leads to an increase in peak demand, we show that adding a capacity-pricing component is able to counteract this effect. The capacity-pricing component successfully reduces the cooperative's peak demand and also increases the cost savings potential. Effective peak shaving is furthermore only possible in a cooperative setting. We conclude that cooperative DR programs are not only beneficial to customers but also to energy providers. The use of appropriate tariffs allows consumers and suppliers to share these benefits fairly.},

abstract = {This paper presents a communication-less distributed voltage control strategy for a multi-bus AC islanded microgrid. First, a Kalman Filter-based network voltage estimator is proposed to obtain voltage responses without communication links in the presence of load disturbances. Then, a voltage optimal controller using MPC (Model Predictive Control) are developed to implement voltage optimal control. The contributions of this paper are demonstrated: (1) The proposed voltage estimator can dynamically obtain network voltage responses just through local voltage and current associated with each DG (Distributed Generator) unit rather than relying on any communication facilities; (2) In contrast to the conventional PI-based voltage control method, the proposed voltage control strategy can implement not only offset-free control for single-bus, but also optimal control for multi-bus. Thus the flexibility and reliability is improved for islanded microgrids due to communication-less operation. The simulations and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed distributed voltage control strategy.},

The data available consisted of the hourly loads for the 20 zones and hourly temperatures from 11 weather stations, for four and a half years. For each zone, the hourly electricity loads for nine different weeks needed to be predicted without having the locations of either the zones or stations. We used separate models for each hourly period, with component-wise gradient boosting for estimating each model using univariate penalised regression splines as base learners. The models allow for the electricity demand changing with the time-of-year, day-of-week, time-of-day, and on public holidays, with the main predictors being current and past temperatures, and past demand.

In particular, a system model that includes a physical battery model and a voltage regulation and peak load shaving oriented energy management system (EMS) is developed to apply the proposed strategy. The cost-benefit analysis presented in this paper considers factors of BESS influence on the work stress of voltage regulation devices, load shifting and peaking power generation, as well as individual BESS cost with its lifetime estimation.

In this article we describe a distributed algorithm for residential energy management in smart power grids. This algorithm consists of a market-oriented multi-agent system using virtual energy prices, levels of renewable energy in the real-time production mix, and historical price information, to achieve a shifting of loads to periods with a high production of renewable energy. Evaluations in our smart grid simulator for three scenarios show that the designed algorithm is capable of improving the self consumption of renewable energy in a residential area and reducing the average and peak loads for externally supplied power.},

The EV fleets could serve as electricity load when drawing energy from the grid and as energy storage (vehicle-to-grid) when delivering energy to the grid. The paper considers two operating modes for EV fleets which are consumer-controlled and grid-controlled. The power grid generation mix represents a multitude of units including thermal, hydro, and wind. The paper considers the impact of EV battery utilization on offsetting the hourly variability of wind generation units in transmission-constrained power grids. The paper considers charging/discharging schedule of EV batteries and consumer driving requirements on the optimal hourly transmission-constrained commitment and dispatch of generation units in the day-ahead scheduling. The hourly solution of the proposed method will minimize the cost of supplying the hourly load while satisfying the temporal constraints of individual components in power grids.},

abstract = {Several situations in a microgrid (MG) cause unbalances leading to voltage and frequency variations. Conventionally MG power balance is ensured by storage battery units along with unscheduled load shedding. This paper presents control and management strategies to coordinate MG resources including generation, smart electric vehicles, and loads for frequency and voltage regulation to achieve optimal autonomous operation. MG control is designed in two layers of network, i.e., neighbour area network (NAN) and house area network (HAN). MG central controller operates at NAN layer, local load controllers operate at HAN layer, and smart electric vehicle controllers operate at both NAN and HAN layers. Two strategies-comprehensive control (CC) and vehicle aided CC-are developed and implemented in 11/0.4 kV urban residential four-feeder distribution system operating as MG. Both strategies enable calculative load manipulation for demand response (DR) considering customer load priority, thus maximizing customer satisfaction. The simulation results validate the proposed strategies providing frequency regulation and DR for MG autonomous operation. The proposed control and management strategy also provides an on-line tool for household maximum demand allocation and load management.},

As a result it becomes harder for the distribution networks infrastructure to remain within its operating constraints. Energy storage is a potential alternative to conventional network reinforcement such as upgrading cables and transformers. The research presented here in this paper shows that due to the volatile nature of the LV network, the control approach used for energy storage has a significant impact on performance. This paper presents and compares control methodologies for energy storage where the objective is to get the greatest possible peak demand reduction across the day from a pre-specified storage device. The results presented show the benefits and detriments of specific types of control on a storage device connected to a single phase of an LV network, using aggregated demand profiles based on real smart meter data from individual homes. The research demonstrates an important relationship between how predictable an aggregation is and the best control methodology required to achieve the objective.},

Second, the solution from the stochastic unit commitment is used to derive a flexible schedule for energy storage in economic dispatch where the look-ahead horizon is limited.

Our model ranked fourth in the Power and En- ergy Society (PES) wind power forecasting competition. The fore- casting model uses 52 Neural Network (NN) sub-models and five Gaussian Process (GP) sub-models in parallel. For 48 hours, the NN sub-models forecast the future wind power based on historical wind power data and forecasted wind information. In parallel, for the first five hours, five GP sub-models are used to forecast wind power using only historical wind power in order to provide accurate wind power forecasts to NN sub-models. These models provide various forecasts for the same hour, so the optimal fore- cast should be decided from overlapped forecasts by the decision process. Index},

The microgrid framework offers a means to capitalize on diverse energy sources in a decentralized way, while reducing the burden on the utility grid by generating power close to the consumer. As a critical component to enabling power system diversity and flexibility, microgrids encompass distributed generators and load centers with the capability of operating islanded from or interconnected to the macrogrid. To make microgrids viable, new and innovative techniques are required for managing microgrid operations given its multi-objective, multi-constraint decision environment. In this article, two example computational intelligence methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO), for application to the microgrid power management problem are introduced. A mathematical framework for multi-objective optimization is presented, as well as a discussion of the advantages of intelligent methods over traditional computational techniques for optimization. Finally, a three-generator microgrid with an ACO-based power management algorithm is demonstrated and results are shown.},

These demand estimates are compared with corresponding actual values. It is shown that application of sophisticated technological classical forecasting techniques to the forecasting problem of a typical fast-growing utility with dynamic load characteristics gives peak demand forecasts with varying degree of accuracy over the forecasting periods considered. This is mainly due to the inherent inability of these methods to simulate the complex load characteristics arising from the interactions of seasonality, trend, and cyclic moving special events. An attempt is made to isolate the effects of these events and to separately forecast the static and dynamic components of the system demand. The accuracy of the forecasted demand thus obtained is comparatively better than that of the forecast obtained},

abstract = {High wind power penetration in power system leads to a significant challenge in balancing power production and consumption due to the intermittence of wind. Introducing energy storage system in wind energy system can help offset the negative effects, and make the wind power controllable. However, the power spectrum density of wind power outputs shows that the fluctuations of wind energy include various components with different frequencies and amplitudes. This implies that the hybrid energy storage system is more suitable for smoothing out the wind power fluctuations effectively rather than the independent energy storage system. In this paper, we proposed a preliminary scheme for capacity allocation of hybrid energy storage system for power system peak shaving by using spectral analysis method. The unbalance power generated from load dispatch plan and wind power outputs is decomposed into four components, which are outer-day, intra-day, short-term and very short-term components, by using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and spectral decomposition method. The capacity allocation can be quantified according to the information in these components. The simulation results show that the power rating and energy rating of hybrid energy storage system in partial smoothing mode decrease significantly in comparison with those in fully smoothing mode.},

@article{Patsios2016,
abstract = {This paper presents an integrated modelling methodology which includes reduced-order models of a lithium ion battery and a power electronic converter, connected to a 35-bus distribution network model. The literature contains many examples of isolated modelling of individual energy storage mediums, power electronic interfaces and control algorithms for energy storage. However, when assessing the performance of a complete energy storage system, the interaction between components gives rise to a range of phenomena that are difficult to quantify if studied in isolation. This paper proposes an integrated electro-thermo-chemical modelling methodology that seeks to address this problem directly by integrating reduced-order models of battery cell chemistry, power electronic circuits and grid operation into a computationally efficient framework. The framework is capable of simulation speeds over 100 times faster than real-time and captures phenomena typically not observed in simpler battery and power converter models or non-integrated frameworks. All simulations are performed using real system load profiles recorded in the United Kingdom. To illustrate the advantages inherent in such a modelling approach, two specific interconnected effects are investigated: the effect of the choice of battery float state-of-charge on overall system efficiency and the rate of battery degradation (capacity/power fade). Higher state-of-charge operation offers improved efficiency due to lower polarisation losses of the battery and lower losses in the converter, however, an increase in the rate of battery degradation is observed due to the accelerated growth of the solid-electrolyte interphase layer. We demonstrate that grid control objectives can be met in several different ways, but that the choices made can result in a substantial improvement in system roundtrip efficiency, with up to a 43{\%} reduction in losses, or reduction in battery degradation by a factor of two, depending on battery system use case.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new genetic algorithm (GA)-based approach for the simultaneous power quality improvement and optimal placement and sizing of fixed capacitor banks in radial distribution networks in the presence of voltage and current harmonics. The objective function includes the cost of power losses, energy losses and that of the capacitor banks. Constraints include voltage limits, number/size and locations of installed capacitors (at each bus and the entire feeder) and the power quality limits of standard IEEE-519. Candidate buses for capacitor placement are selected based on an initial generation of chromosomes. Using a proposed fitness function, a suitable combination of objective and constraints is defined as a criterion to select (among the candidates) the most suitable buses for capacitor placement. A genetic algorithm computes improved generations of chromosomes and candidate buses until the solution is obtained. Simulation results for two IEEE distorted networks are presented and solutions of the genetic algorithm are compared with those of the maximum-sensitivities-selection (MSS), the maximum sensitivities selection-local variations (MSS-LV), and the fuzzy set algorithms. The main contribution of this paper is the computation of the near global solution, with weak dependency on initial conditions.},

To efficiently control the OLTC network monitoring might be considered. This work assesses the performance of a proposed OLTC control logic considering different remote monitoring schemes and control cycles. A Monte Carlo-based time-series analysis is applied to a real UK residential LV network considering different uneven PV penetrations per feeder. Results show that the adoption of monitoring only at the end of each feeder can provide a satisfactory performance of customer voltages (BS EN50160 compliant). Additionally, the proposed control logic with a 30-minute control cycle can reduce the number of tap changes whilst producing a good voltage performance. The results can help distribution network operators determining the most adequate control approaches for OLTC-fitted transformers in future LV networks.},

abstract = {A microgrid is an eco-friendly power system because renewable sources are used as main power sources. In the islanded operation mode of a microgrid, maintaining the balance between power supply and power demand is a very important problem. In the case of surplus supply, decreased generation output and/or charge of distributed storages can be applied to solve the imbalance between power supply and demand. In the case of supply shortages, increased generation output and/or discharge of distributed storages can be applied. Especially in the case of critical supply shortages, load shedding should be applied. In a distributed load-shedding approach, microgrid components need to make decisions autonomously. For autonomous microgrid operation, a multi-agent system has been investigated. In this paper, a distributed load-shedding system for agent-based autonomous operation of a microgrid is designed. The designed system is implemented and tested to show the functionality and feasibility of the proposed system.},

abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are likely to have a continued presence in the light-vehicle market in the next few decades. As a result, EV charging will put an extra burden on the distribution grid and adjustments need to be made in some cases. On the other hand, EVs have the potential to support the grid as well. This paper presents a single-phase bidirectional charger topology which pairs up a photovoltaic (PV) source with an EV charger resulting in production cost reduction. The presented topology is then used for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services. The main focus of this paper is on power quality services which only slightly discharge the battery. Among these services, it studies the possibility of local reactive injection of EVs connected to the grid through a single-phase charger to compensate for voltage drops caused by motor startup or inductive loads. It also studies the possibility of active power injection of EVs for short time periods during PV transients in cloudy weather to keep the system stable. It also studies the potential of EVs to help during low voltage ride-through of the PV sources. The studies are performed using Simulink simulations and a real-time implementation in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of power quality V2G services with small wear on the EV battery.},

abstract = {Rising concerns about the efficiency, reliability, economics, and sustainability in electricity production and distribution have been driving an evolution of the traditional electric power grid toward smart grid. A key enabler of the smart grid is the two-way communications throughout the power system, based on which an advanced information system can make optimal decisions on power system operation. Due to the expected deep penetration of renewable energy sources, energy storage devices, demand side management (DSM) tools, and electric vehicles (EVs) in the future smart grid, there exist significant technical challenges on power system planning and operation. Specifically, efficient stochastic information management schemes should be developed to address the randomness in renewable power generation, buffering effect of energy storage devices, consumer behavior patterns in the context of DSM, and high mobility of EVs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive literature survey on the stochastic information management schemes for the smart grid. We start this survey with an introduction to the smart grid system architecture and the technical challenges in information management. Various component-level modeling techniques are presented to characterize the sources of randomness in the smart grid. Built upon the component-level models, we further explore the system-level stochastic information management schemes for smart grid planning and operation. Future research directions and open research issues are identified.},

abstract = {Alternative vehicles, such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, are becoming more popular. The batteries of these plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are to be charged at home from a standard outlet or on a corporate car park. These extra electrical loads have an impact on the distribution grid which is analyzed in terms of power losses and voltage deviations. Without coordination of the charging, the vehicles are charged instantaneously when they are plugged in or after a fixed start delay. This uncoordinated power consumption on a local scale can lead to grid problems. Therefore, coordinated charging is proposed to minimize the power losses and to maximize the main grid load factor. The optimal charging profile of the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles is computed by minimizing the power losses. As the exact forecasting of household loads is not possible, stochastic programming is introduced. Two main techniques are analyzed: quadratic and dynamic programming.},

abstract = {To get the distribution network to operate at its optimum performance in an automated distribution system reconfiguration was been proposed and researched. Considering, however, that optimum performance implies minimum loss, no overloading of transformers and cables, correct voltage profile, and absence of phase voltage and current imbalances, network reconfiguration alone is insufficient. It has to be complemented with techniques for phase rearrangement between the distribution transformer banks and the specific primary feeder with a radial structure and dynamic phase and load balancing along a feeder with a radial structure. This paper contributes such a technique at the low-voltage and medium-voltage levels of a distribution network simultaneously with reconfiguration at both levels. While the neural network is adopted for the network reconfiguration problem, this paper introduces a heuristic method for the phase balancing/loss minimization problem. A comparison of the heuristic algorithm with that of the neural network shows the former to be more robust. The approach proposed here, therefore for the combined problem, uses the neural network in conjunction with a heuristic method which enables different reconfiguration switches to be turned on/off and connected consumers to be switched between different phases to keep the phases balanced. An application example of the proposed method using real data is presented.},

This paper proposes a distributed multi-agent-based load shedding algorithm, which can make efficient load shedding decision based on discovered global information. During the information discovery process, only communications between immediate neighboring agents are used. The information discovery algorithm is represented as a discrete time linear system and the stability of which is analyzed according to average-consensus theorem. According to rigorous stability analysis, convergence of the designed algorithm can be guaranteed. To improve the speed of the algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the coefficients for information exchange so that the second largest eigenvalue of the iteration matrix is minimized. According to the designed algorithm, total net active power and operating status of loads can be discovered accurately even with faults. Based on the discovered information, coordinated load shedding decision can be made.},

A growing group of engineers, grid operators, and regulatory agencies believe that energy storage will be a critical component of the “grid of the future.” Over the past several decades, large-scale hydro and pumped hydro storage facilities dominated the energy storage landscape. Today, new and evolving battery chemistries, primarily for electric vehicle and backup power applications, are emerging as potential solutions for some of the challenges that face the grid today. Both batteries and high-speed mechanical flywheels-connected to the grid through power electronics-are enabling smaller and more modular energy storage systems.

We derived a nominal realistic driving schedule based on aggregating driving survey data and the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, and used a vehicle physics model to create a daily battery duty cycle. Different degrees of continuous discharge were imposed on the cells to mimic afternoon V2G use to displace grid electricity. The loss of battery capacity was quantified as a function of driving days as well as a function of integrated capacity and energy processed by the cells. The cells tested showed promising capacity fade performance: more than 95{\%} of the original cell capacity remains after thousands of driving days worth of use. Statistical analyses indicate that rapid vehicle motive cycling degraded the cells more than slower, V2G galvanostatic cycling.

Such a traditional mode, lacking of automatic coordination in a system level, is no longer fit for the higher requirements of security and economy of modern large power system operation. In recent years, development and field site applications of close-looped system-wide automatic voltage control (AVC) technique were actively done in China. In the paper, a novel control architecture based on online adaptive network zone division is proposed. Logically such a system is in a three level hierarchical structure, however, both secondary voltage control and tertiary voltage control here are implemented with software in a control center, and the control zones are no longer fixed according to variation in power systems, which is more suitable for the fast developing Chinese power grids. Some key techniques implemented in the AVC system are introduced, such as adaptive zone division, strategies of Tertiary Voltage Control (TVC), strategies of secondary voltage control (SVC), etc. Finally some field experiences, especially some results not from simulation tool but from field site applications, are reported. The excellent performance of the AVC system and significant improvements on power system security and economy are validated. The developed AVC system has been applied to more than a dozen control centers in China, such as the North China Power Grid with generating capacity of 119GW. Evaluation of the potential profits of the proposed AVC system on PJM system in USA is ongoing.},

This paper has addressed voltage support in distribution systems by energy injection from a battery storage distributed energy system. An operation strategy for an inverter interface battery energy storage DER has been developed for maximum improvement in feeder voltage with minimum energy injection from the DER. A control strategy has been proposed for inverter based battery storage DER to regulate network voltage effectively, through operating the DER to generate real (P) and reactive (Q) power with Q priority. The implementation of the inverter interface DER with battery energy storage will save fuel cost of DER but be of much higher capital cost than using a rotary generator. The proposed technique has been evaluated by simulation on a three-phase distribution system with time varying loads. Test results indicate that DER operating with Q priority offers the best solution for maximum voltage improvement. The results also confirm that DER injecting P and Q at the ratio of maximum voltage sensitivity of line presents better solution for power loss reduction than the solution offered by the DER operating with Q priority. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Here we concentrate on and give results only for one day ahead forecasts although the method is also applicable for 7-10 days ahead. A forecasting model has been developed which identifies a 'normal' or weather-insensitive load component and a weather-sensitive load component. Linear regression analysis of past load and weather data is used to identify the normal load model. The weather-sensitive component of the load is estimated using the parameters of the regression analysis. Certain design features of the short-term load forecasting system are important for its successful operation over time. These include adaptability to changing operational conditions, computational economy and robustness. An automated load forecasting system is presented here that includes these design features. A fully automated algorithm for updating the model is described in detail as are the techniques employed in both the identification and treatment of influential points in the data base and the selection of predictors for the weather-load model. Monthly error statistics of forecast load for only one day ahead are presented for recorded weather conditions.},

abstract = {Scalable management and scheduling of dynamic grid resources requires new technologies to build the next generation intelligent grid environments. This work demonstrates that AI techniques can be utilised to achieve effective workload and resource management. A combination of intelligent agents and multi-agent approaches is applied to both local grid resource scheduling and global grid load balancing. Each agent is a representative of a local grid resource and utilises predictive application performance data with iterative heuristic algorithms to engineer local load balancing across multiple hosts. At a higher level, agents cooperate with each other to balance workload using a peer-to-peer service advertisement and discovery mechanism. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this scheme, residential loads are transferred from one phase to another to minimize VU along the feeder. The central controller, installed at the distribution transformer, observes the power consumption in each house and determines the house(s) to be transferred from an initially connected phase to another. The transfer is carried out by the help of a static transfer switch, with a three-phase input and a single-phase output connection, through which each house is supplied. The steady-state and dynamic performances of the proposed load transfer scheme are investigated by MATLAB analyses and PSCAD/EMTDC simulations.},

@article{Gill2014,
abstract = {Active Network Management is a philosophy for the operation of distribution networks with high penetrations of renewable distributed generation. Technologies such as energy storage and flexible demand are now beginning to be included in Active Network Management (ANM) schemes. Optimizing the operation of these schemes requires consideration of inter-temporal linkages as well as network power flow effects. Network effects are included in optimal power flow (OPF) solutions but this only optimizes for a single point in time. Dynamic optimal power flow (DOPF) is an extension of OPF to cover multiple time periods. This paper reviews the generic formulation of DOPF before developing a framework for modeling energy technologies with inter-temporal characteristics in an ANM context. The framework includes the optimization of nonfirm connected generation, principles of access for nonfirm generators, energy storage, and flexible demand. Two objectives based on maximizing export and revenue are developed and a case study is used to illustrate the technique. Results show that DOPF is able to successfully schedule these energy technologies. DOPF schedules energy storage and flexible demand to reduce generator curtailment significantly in the case study. Finally, the role of DOPF in analyzing ANM schemes is discussed with reference to extending the optimization framework to include other technologies and objectives.},

abstract = {In this paper, we analyze and quantify functional value streams of energy storage under different forms (state in which energy is stored) and network location (e.g., transmission or distribution sides). First, we consider a transmission-connected thermal form of storage coupled with concentrating solar power. Using the California power grid as a case study, we show that the coupled unit is significantly less volatile in its response and, through its load following, day-ahead dispatching, and regulation capabilities, it produces significant cost savings. Another case study examines the value of the electrical form of storage in a distribution network and in coupling with photovoltaics. The energy storage is used to mitigate component overloads and to reduce the subsequent infrastructure investments, and smooth out the intermittency of renewable generation. Storage value is quantified formally and under optimal control configuration of storage charge and discharging. Finally, a case study is constructed to examine the functional value of substation-sited storage with respect to investment deferral for the substation transformer.},

The proposed analytical ex- pressions are based on an improvement to the method that was limited to DG type, which is capable of delivering real power only. Three other types, e.g., DG capable of delivering both real and re- active power, DG capable of delivering real power and absorbing reactive power, and DG capable of delivering reactive power only, can also be identified with their optimal size and location using the proposed method. The method has been tested in three test dis- tribution systems with varying size and complexity and validated using exhaustive method. Results show that the proposed method requires less computation, but can lead optimal solution as verified by the exhaustive load flow method.},

@article{Bongiorno2007,
abstract = {In this paper, a voltage source converter (VSC) connected in shunt with the grid to mitigate voltage dips for sensitive processes is presented. The VSC maintains the magnitude of the grid voltage at the connection point constant by injecting reactive power to compensate for the voltage dip. This is achieved by using a cascade controller, constituted by an inner vector current-controller (VCC) and an outer voltage controller, which calculates the current references for the VCC. The paper shows that using an inductor/capacitor/inductor (LCL)-filter instead of the simpler L-filter in between the VSC and the grid yields high performance and robust controller. Furthermore, in order to compensate for unbalanced dips, both positive- and negative-sequence components of the grid voltage must be controlled separately. This is done by using two independent controllers for the two sequences, with the same cascaded structure described above. Simulation results under balanced and unbalanced dips are presented to show the performance. Also, stability analyses are done to determine the robustness of the system against grid parameter variation.},

abstract = {As fundamental storage technologies improve in terms of performance and cost their use on electricity networks will become increasingly attractive. It is likely that the business cases that emerge will continue to be sensitive to the ability to capture value streams from delivering more than one service. Successful service delivery will be dependent on the availability of appropriate and effective planning and operating schemes. Validation of these schemes through demonstration projects is an essential step in building the experience and knowledge required to widely deploy energy storage in electricity networks. The chapter covers a range of the work that has been undertaken by researchers, working with the electricity industry, to advance the understanding of energy storage. The importance of policy and markets in creating an acceptable commercial environment is described. Methods used for network planning of energy storage installations are outlined. Operational strategies, both for individual storage units, multiple units, and in combination with other technologies are provided. Examples of demonstration projects and their outcomes illustrate postal progress in deploying energy storage live networks. Finally, advanced methods for integrated storage modeling are explained, with examples of the findings that can be made. Under current regulatory and electricity market conditions, conventional solutions, such as fossil fuel-based peaking plants for covering peak electricity demand, are seen as cheaper technologies when compared with energy storage systems (ESS). However, this does not necessarily represent the true cost and value of ESS. This circumstance is expected to change as ESS technologies continue to advance, capital costs reduce, deployment experience increases, and there is the opportunity to reconcile multiple value streams. To enable grid-connected energy storage to flourish, effort is required in a number of areas: (1) Energy policy decisions must be reviewed and ESS policies must be aligned with those for renewable energy systems (RES) so that the ability of ESS to add RES capacity to the system is rewarded. (2) Regulatory rules need to be examined; a new asset class and associated regulation specifically for ESS is advisable; and standardized evaluation methods for determining the value of storage in power systems would reduce investor uncertainty. (3) Updated ancillary services markets to provide adequate compensation for technologies that can respond quickly and with high accuracy. (4) Operation schemes should be investigated; the capture of multiple value streams is dependent on the ability to control storage in a way that can balance competing requirements appropriately. (5) Roadmap for ESS deployment on the grid; if ESS is considered as a potential solution, it is important that plans, targets, and goals for the use of ESS are established. (6) Development of sophisticated modeling tools; the properties of storage media and demands placed by grid control requirements are complex and at times contradictory. Integrated modeling of these will allow the development of schemes that are able to be more cost effective. (7) Deployment of projects; an increasing number of storage installations are in operation, but the multifaceted nature of storage means that further novel applications still need to be deployed. Addressing these seven areas will mean that the potential of energy storage for supporting electricity networks can be practically realized.},

@article{Filik2011,
abstract = {In this study, a novel mathematical method is proposed for modeling and forecasting electric energy demand. The method is capable of making long-term forecasts. However, unlike other long-term forecasting models, the proposed method produces hourly results with improved accuracy. The model is constructed and verified using 26-year-long real-life load data (4 years with hourly resolution) obtained from the Turkish Electric Power Company. The overall method consists of a nested combination of three subsections for modeling. The first section is the coarse level for modeling variations of yearly average loads. The second section refines this structure by modeling weekly residual load variations within a year. The final section reaches to the hourly resolution by modeling variations within a week, using a novel 2-D mathematical representation at this resolution. The adoptions of such nested forecasting methodology together with the proposed 2-D representation for hourly load constitute the novelties of this work. The major advantage of the proposed approach is that it enables the possibility of making short-, medium-, and long-term hourly load forecasting within a single framework. Several mathematical functions are applied as models at each level of the nested system for achieving the minimal forecasting error. Proposed model functions with their corresponding forecasting accuracies are presented in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A field trial of an energy storage system designed and built by ABB is taking place on a section of 11. kV distribution network operated by EDF Energy Networks in Great Britain. This paper reports on the findings from simulation software developed at Durham University that evaluates the benefits brought by operating an energy storage system in response to multiple events on multiple networks. The tool manages the allocation of a finite energy resource to achieve the most beneficial shared operation across two adjacent areas of distribution network. Simulations account for the key energy storage system parameters of capacity and power rating. Results for events requiring voltage control and power flow management show how the choice of operating strategy influences the benefits achieved. The wider implications of these results are discussed to provide an assessment of the role of electrical energy storage systems in future Smart Grids. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Microgrid (MG) is a promising component for future smart grid (SG) deployment. The balance of supply and demand of electric energy is one of the most important requirements of MG management. In this paper, we present a novel framework for smart energy management based on the concept of quality-of-service in electricity (QoSE). Specifically, the resident electricity demand is classified into basic usage and quality usage. The basic usage is always guaranteed by the MG, while the quality usage is controlled based on the MG state. The microgrid control center (MGCC) aims to minimize the MG operation cost and maintain the outage probability of quality usage, i.e., QoSE, below a target value, by scheduling electricity among renewable energy resources, energy storage systems, and macrogrid. The problem is formulated as a constrained stochastic programming problem. The Lyapunov optimization technique is then applied to derive an adaptive electricity scheduling algorithm by introducing the QoSE virtual queues and energy storage virtual queues. The proposed algorithm is an online algorithm since it does not require any statistics and future knowledge of the electricity supply, demand and price processes. We derive several "hard" performance bounds for the proposed algorithm, and evaluate its performance with trace-driven simulations. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed electricity scheduling algorithm.},

The programming model combines optimally three types of energy management decisions: grid-to-vehicle charges, vehicle-to-grid discharges, and novel vehicle-to-vehicle energy exchanges. The objective function maximizes the net energy supplied to batteries minimizing simultaneously the global energy cost. A 50-plug-in vehicle park case is analyzed for three possible mobility patterns: household, commercial and mixed. Outputs from the DLC model are compared with the ones using a dumb charging policy from the service quality and economic points of view. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been done to evaluate the economic impact of the Depth of Discharge condition to preserve battery lifecycle of electric vehicles.},

It is shown that load models can significantly affect the optimal location and sizing of DG resources in distribution systems. The proposed multi-objective function to be optimised includes a short-circuit-level parameter to represent the protective device requirements. The proposed function also considers a wide range of technical issues such as active and reactive power losses of the system, the voltage profile, the line loading and the Mega Volt Ampere (MVA) intake by the grid. The optimisation technique based on particle swarm optimisation is introduced. The analysis of continuation power flow to determine the effect of DG units on the most sensitive buses to voltage collapse is carried out. The proposed algorithm is tested using the 38-bus radial system and the IEEE 30-bus meshed system. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {Alternative vehicles based on internal combustion engines (ICE), such as the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) and the fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV), are becoming increasingly popular. HEVs are currently commercially available and PHEVs will be the next phase in the evolution of hybrid and electric vehicles. The batteries of the PHEVs are designed to be charged at home, from a standard outlet in the garage, or on a corporate car park. The electrical consumption for charging PHEVs may take up to 5{\%} of the total electrical consumption in Belgium by 2030. These extra electrical loads have an impact on the distribution grid which is analyzed in terms of power losses and voltage deviations. Firstly, the uncoordinated charging is described where the vehicles are charged immediately when they are plugged in or after a fixed start delay. This uncoordinated power consumption on a local scale can lead to grid problems. Therefore coordinated charging is proposed to minimize the power losses and to maximize the main grid load factor. The optimal charge profile of the PHEVs is computed by minimizing the power losses. The exact forecasting of household loads is not possible, so stochastic programming is introduced.},

We propose a new voltage control scheme for distribution networks based on a multi-agent system. The large voltage fluctuations caused by PV generations are effectively regulated by adjusting the conventional types of tap-changing controllers. We achieved an optimal control performance by developing a new optimal control law applicable to decentralized autonomous control. The autonomy is accomplished by using a multi-agent system. The proposed method is applicable to general distribution network and highly efficient for popular radial networks under certain approximations. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulations of radial 6.6-kV test system with successful results.},

abstract = {This paper assesses the impact of the location and configuration of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) on Low-Voltage (LV) feeders. BESS are now being deployed on LV networks by Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) as an alternative to conventional reinforcement (e.g. upgrading cables and transformers) in response to increased electricity demand from new technologies such as electric vehicles. By storing energy during periods of low demand and then releasing that energy at times of high demand, the peak demand of a given LV substation on the grid can be reduced therefore mitigating or at least delaying the need for replacement and upgrade. However, existing research into this application of BESS tends to evaluate the aggregated impact of such systems at the substation level and does not systematically consider the impact of the location and configuration of BESS on the voltage profiles, losses and utilisation within a given feeder. In this paper, four configurations of BESS are considered: single-phase, unlinked three-phase, linked three-phase without storage for phase-balancing only, and linked three-phase with storage. These four configurations are then assessed based on models of two real LV networks. In each case, the impact of the BESS is systematically evaluated at every node in the LV network using Matlab linked with OpenDSS. The location and configuration of a BESS is shown to be critical when seeking the best overall network impact or when considering specific impacts on voltage, losses, or utilisation separately. Furthermore, the paper also demonstrates that phase-balancing without energy storage can provide much of the gains on unbalanced networks compared to systems with energy storage.},

abstract = {Renewable energy resources (RES) are being increasingly connected in distribution systems utilizing power electronic converters. This paper presents a novel control strategy for achieving maximum benefits from these grid-interfacing inverters when installed in 3-phase 4-wire distribution systems. The inverter is controlled to perform as a multi-function device by incorporating active power filter functionality. The inverter can thus be utilized as: 1) power converter to inject power generated from RES to the grid, and 2) shunt APF to compensate current unbalance, load current harmonics, load reactive power demand and load neutral current. All of these functions may be accomplished either individually or simultaneously. With such a control, the combination of grid-interfacing inverter and the 3-phase 4-wire linear/non-linear unbalanced load at point of common coupling appears as balanced linear load to the grid. This new control concept is demonstrated with extensive MATLAB/Simulink simulation studies and validated through digital signal processor-based laboratory experimental results.},

Over the past 100 plus years, both research efforts and industry practices in this area have focused primarily on point load forecasting. In the most recent decade, though, the increased market competition, aging infrastructure and renewable integration requirements mean that probabilistic load forecasting has become more and more important to energy systems planning and operations. This paper offers a tutorial review of probabilistic electric load forecasting, including notable techniques, methodologies and evaluation methods, and common misunderstandings. We also underline the need to invest in additional research, such as reproducible case studies, probabilistic load forecast evaluation and valuation, and a consideration of emerging technologies and energy policies in the probabilistic load forecasting process.},

abstract = {More and more households are purchasing electric vehicles (EVs), and this will continue as we move towards a low carbon future. There are various projections as to the rate of EV uptake, but all predict an increase over the next ten years. Charging these EVs will produce one of the biggest loads on the low voltage network. To manage the network, we must not only take into account the number of EVs taken up, but where on the network they are charging, and at what time. To simulate the impact on the network from high, medium and low EV uptake (as outlined by the UK government), we present an agent-based model. We initialise the model to assign an EV to a household based on either random distribution or social influences - that is, a neighbour of an EV owner is more likely to also purchase an EV. Additionally, we examine the effect of peak behaviour on the network when charging is at day-time, night-time, or a mix of both. The model is implemented on a neighbourhood in south-east England using smart meter data (half hourly electricity readings) and real life charging patterns from an EV trial. Our results indicate that social influence can increase the peak demand on a local level (street or feeder), meaning that medium EV uptake can create higher peak demand than currently expected.},

This paper presents a solution method for the distribution expansion planning problem including DG. The proposed algorithm is based on binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO). The aim of the model is to satisfy operational and economical requirements by using DG as a candidate alternative for distribution system planning and avoiding or at least reducing: expanding existing substations, and upgrading existing feeders. The model decides the locations and size of the new facilities in the system as well as the amount of the purchased power from the main grid. the conventional weighted aggregation (CWA) method is used to solve the multi- objective optimization problem so that further objectives functions can be added. The results show that the DG's introduce economical and electrical benefits to the system including improved voltage profile, feeders loading and losses.},

abstract = {This research study examines the peak energy reduction potential and avoided cost from using an automatic thermostat set point control strategy in a residential home which responds to the price variation in a time-of-use tariff. Twelve benchmark homes, composed of three different home sizes in four different geographical locations, are each evaluated under twelve unique control scenarios with systematically varied peak period length, rate ratio, and set point offset. All time-of-use tariffs are designed to be cost neutral with the existing flat rate tariff assuming the same base case operating scenario. Historical real time prices for 2008 and regional specific construction features were used. The total savings potential as well as the additional benefit from increased set point offsets were found to be highly dependent on the climate. For a particular location, savings on a percentage basis were very consistent across home sizes for similar control strategies, meaning the same tariff may be applied to all residential customers without disadvantaging customers in smaller homes. Finally, the utility cost savings varied from {\$}225 to {\$}9 per home with many time-of-use tariffs resulting in more money given to the homeowner than actually saved by the utility. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Grid connected energy storage systems are regarded as promising solutions for providing ancillary services to electricity networks and to play an important role in the development of smart grids. Thus far, the more mature battery technologies have been installed in pilot projects and studies have indicated their main advantages and shortcomings. The main concerns for wide adoption are the overall cost, the limited number of charging cycles (or lifetime), the depth of discharge, the low energy density and the sustainability of materials used. Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries (VRFB) are a promising option to mitigate many of these shortcomings, and demonstration projects using this technology are being implemented both in Europe and in the USA. This study presents a model using MATLAB/Simulink, to demonstrate how a VRFB based storage device can provide multi-ancillary services, focusing on frequency regulation and peak-shaving functions. The study presents a storage system at a medium voltage substation and considers a small grid load profile, originating from a residential neighbourhood and fast charging stations demand. The model also includes an inverter controller that provides a net power output from the battery system, in order to offer both services simultaneously. Simulation results show that the VRFB storage device can regulate frequency effectively due to its fast response time, while still performing peak-shaving services. VRFB potential in grid connected systems is discussed to increase awareness of decision makers, while identifying the main challenges for wider implementation of storage systems, particularly related to market structure and standardisation requirements.},

This article reports on trial design approaches and their application to a UK trial of an EES system to ensure broad applicability of the results. Results from these trials of an EES system, low carbon technologies and trial distribution networks are used to develop validated power system models.

The goal is to balance the local heat demand and supply in combination with balancing the power supply and demand in the network. The on-off decisions of the local generators are done completely distributed based on local information and information exchange with a few neighbors in the network. This is achieved by using an information sharing model with a distributed model predictive control method based on dual-decomposition and sub-gradient iterations. Because of the binary nature of the decisions, a mixed integer quadratic problem is solved at each agent. The approach is tested with simulation, using realistic heat and power demand patterns. We conclude that the distributed control approach is suitable for embedding the distributed generation at a household level. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable energy (namely wind energy and solar PV) may entail new challenges in power systems and more volatility in power prices in liberalized electricity markets. Energy storage can diminish this imbalance, relieving the grid congestion, and promoting distributed generation. The economic implications of grid-scale electrical energy storage technologies are however obscure for the experts, power grid operators, regulators, and power producers. A meticulous technoeconomic or cost-benefit analysis of electricity storage systems requires consistent, updated cost data and a holistic cost analysis framework. To this end, this study critically examines the existing literature in the analysis of life cycle costs of utility-scale electricity storage systems, providing an updated database for the cost elements (capital costs, operational and maintenance costs, and replacement costs). Moreover, life cycle costs and levelized cost of electricity delivered by electrical energy storage is analyzed, employing Monte Carlo method to consider uncertainties. The examined energy storage technologies include pumped hydropower storage, compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheel, electrochemical batteries (e.g. lead-acid, NaS, Li-ion, and Ni-Cd), flow batteries (e.g. vanadium-redox), superconducting magnetic energy storage, supercapacitors, and hydrogen energy storage (power to gas technologies). The results illustrate the economy of different storage systems for three main applications: bulk energy storage, T{\&}D support services, and frequency regulation.},

@article{Cecati2011,
abstract = {The integration of renewable energy systems (RESs) in smart grids (SGs) is a challenging task, mainly due to the intermittent and unpredictable nature of the sources, typically wind or sun. Another issue concerns the way to support the consumers' participation in the electricity market aiming at minimizing the costs of the global energy consumption. This paper proposes an energy management system (EMS) aiming at optimizing the SG's operation. The EMS behaves as a sort of aggregator of distributed energy resources allowing the SG to participate in the open market. By integrating demand side management (DSM) and active management schemes (AMS), it allows a better exploitation of renewable energy sources and a reduction of the customers' energy consumption costs with both economic and environmental benefits. It can also improve the grid resilience and flexibility through the active participation of distribution system operators (DSOs) and electricity supply/demand that, according to their preferences and costs, respond to real-time price signals using market processes. The efficiency of the proposed EMS is verified on a 23-bus 11-kV distribution network.},

abstract = {This paper presents an optimal power management mechanism for grid connected photovoltaic (PV) systems with storage. The objective is to help intensive penetration of PV production into the grid by proposing peak shaving service at the lowest cost. The structure of a power supervisor based on an optimal predictive power scheduling algorithm is proposed. Optimization is performed using Dynamic Programming and is compared with a simple ruled-based management. The particularity of this study remains first in the consideration of batteries ageing into the optimization process and second in the “day-ahead” approach of power management. Simulations and real conditions application are carried out over one exemplary day. In simulation, it points out that peak shaving is realized with the minimal cost, but especially that power fluctuations on the grid are reduced which matches with the initial objective of helping PV penetration into the grid. In real conditions, efficiency of the predictive schedule depends on accuracy of the forecasts, which leads to future works about optimal reactive power management.},

abstract = {In the environment of ongoing deregulated power industry, traditional automatic generation control (AGC) has become a set of ancillary services traded in separate markets other than the energy market. The performance of AGC is mandated to meet the NERC control performance standards (CPS). The CPS criteria are intended for the over-compliant power utilities to loosen control of their generating units. On the other hand, excess regulating capabilities can be sold for better financial well being. Generation companies have to optimize the portfolio of their generating assets to achieve maximum profitability. The optimization process involves economic allocation of generation over a period of time, which requires the load profile to be predicted for the dispatch period of minute level. This paper addresses the importance of very short term load prediction (VSTLP) in this context, and proposes three new schemes to make load predictions. The VSTLP is developed and implemented as part of Siemenspsila CPS based automatic generation control (AGC) product. Procedures involved in the proposed approaches are presented. Comparison between different approaches is made. Experimental studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

abstract = {Demand Side Management (DSM) is a popular approach for grid-aware peak-shaving. The most commonly used DSM methods either have no look ahead feature and risk deploying flexibility too early, or they plan ahead using predictions, which are in general not very reliable. To counter this, a DSM approach is presented that does not rely on detailed power predictions, but only uses a few easy to predict characteristics. By using these characteristics alone, near optimal results can be achieved for electric vehicle (EV) charging, and a bound on the maximal relative deviation is given. This result is extended to an algorithm that controls a group of EVs such that a transformer peak is avoided, while simultaneously keeping the individual house profiles as flat as possible to avoid cable overloading and for improved power quality. This approach is evaluated using different data sets to compare the results with the state-of-the-art research. The evaluation shows that the presented approach is capable of peak-shaving at the transformer level, while keeping the voltages well within legal bounds, keeping the cable load low and obtaining low losses. Further advantages of the methodology are a low communication overhead, low computational requirements and ease of implementation.},

abstract = {Distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) is one of the well-known and effective strategies adopted in distribution network. The goal of DFR problem is to obtain a new topological structure for distribution feeders by rearranging the status of switches such that an optimal configuration would be obtained. The existence of Distributed Generation (DG) can affect the entire power system and especially distribution networks. This paper presents an efficient approach for multi-objective DFR problem considering the simultaneous effect of DG units. The objective functions to be investigated are 1) power losses, 2) voltage deviation of buses, 3) emission produced by DG units and distribution companies and 4) the total cost of the active power generated by DG units and distribution companies. The new evolutionary method is based on an efficient multi-objective hybrid honey bee mating optimization (HBMO) and shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) called MHBMO-SFLA. The proposed hybrid algorithm integrates the outstanding characteristics of SFLA to improve the performance of HBMO algorithm sufficiently. In the proposed MHBMO-SFLA, an external repository is considered to save non-dominated solutions which are found during the search process. Also, since the objective functions are not the same, a fuzzy clustering technique is utilized to control the size of the repository within the limits. A distribution test feeder is considered to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} Shiraz University.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrated reusing electric vehicle traction lithium ion batteries for solar energy time shifting and demand side management in a single family house. Batteries retired from electric vehicle usage retain 70{\%} to 80{\%} of their capacity and can be re-purposed as stationary storage system at reduced cost. However, they have mismatched aging conditions and unbalanced state-of-charge levels. Under typical series-parallel connection, the cells in a pack are prone to over charging or discharging due to deviated cycling conditions and misestimated states. The demonstrated battery management system included an extended Kalman filter based states estimator, enhanced current shunting, and protective circuitry to ensure system safety. One novel contribution was the introduction of a worst-difference state-of-charge estimation scheme for the battery pack, which places more computational resources on the battery cell of the worst health. The scheme provided satisfactory overall estimation accuracy and offered a method to optimize computational cost when large number of battery cells was integrated. In addition, a function was proposed to indicate the overall states of the entire energy storage system by aggregating the states of the battery cells within. Therefore, the energy management unit was able to dispatch the battery assembly as a unified pack. Three decision-table-based control strategies were demonstrated with objectives to maximize economic benefits, minimize grid energy consumption, or a balance of both. The data obtained from the demonstrating system located in Davis, CA showed that the battery energy storage system was able to successfully mitigate solar intermittency and energy demand fluctuation by charging from excess solar energy and discharging during the period of peak demand. It reduced daily grid energy consumption by 64{\%}???100{\%} and significantly improved solar penetration.},

abstract = {Balanced three-phase four-wire distribution grids can host significantly more distributed generation and electric vehicles. Three-phase photovoltaic (PV) inverters and electric vehicle (EV) chargers can be adapted to transfer power from highly loaded to less loaded phases, without overloading the inverter or charger. Grid conditions will be improved due to a more balanced operation of the network and more PV panels and EVs can be connected before the limits of the network are reached. A classic coordinated charging strategy for EVs is adapted in this paper. It is shown that the charging of EVs can be improved when power can be transferred from one phase to another. Using PV inverters with a balancing inverter, the power injected in each phase will become a controllable variable as the total amount of produced power does not necessarily need to be equally divided across the three phases. The improvements made by using EV chargers and PV inverters that can balance the network are investigated. Several load flow simulations with realistic data show a positive effect on the system losses, the grid voltage, and voltage unbalance. Finally, a local controller is proposed to control the balancing between the phases when a real-time communication channel is not available.},

abstract = {Energy storage is nowadays recognised as a key element in modern energy supply chain. This is mainly because it can enhance grid stability, increase penetration of renewable energy resources, improve the efficiency of energy systems, conserve fossil energy resources and reduce environmental impact of energy generation. Although there are many energy storage technologies already reviewed in the literature, these technologies are currently at different levels of technological maturity with a few already proven for commercial scale application. Most of the review papers in energy storage highlight these technologies in details, however; there remains limited information on the real life application of these technologies for energy storage purpose. This review paper aims to address this gap by providing a detailed analysis of real life application and performance of the different energy storage technologies. The paper discusses the concept of energy storage, the different technologies for the storage of energy with more emphasis on the storage of secondary forms of energy (electricity and heat) as well as a detailed analysis of various energy storage projects all over the world. In the final part of this paper, some of the challenges hindering the commercial deployment of energy storage technologies are also highlighted.},

abstract = {In this paper, the coordinated integration of aggre- gated plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) fleets and renewable energy sources (wind energy) in power systems is studied by stochastic security-constrained unit commitment (Stochastic SCUC) model, which minimizes the expected grid operation cost while consid- ering the random behavior of the many PEVs. PEVs are mobile and distributed devices with deferrable options for the supply/uti- lization of energy at various times and locations. The increased utilization of PEVs, which consume electricity rather than fossil fuel for driving, offers unique economic and environmental oppor- tunities, and brings out new challenges to electric power system operation and planning. The storage capability of PEVs could help power systems mitigate the variability of renewable energy sources and reduce grid operation costs. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enables PEVs to have bi-directional power flows once they are connected to the grid, i.e., they can either inject power to, and draw power from, the grid which adds further complexity to power system operations. PEVs signify customers' random behavior when con- sidering their driving patterns, locational energy requirements, topological grid interconnections, and other constraints imposed by the consumers. Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for analyzing the impact of PEVs on the grid operation cost and hourly wind energy dispatch.},

The effect of parameters such as depth of discharge (DOD), end of charge voltage (EOCV) and overvoltage of the parasitic reaction on the cycle life behavior has been quantitatively analyzed. The experimental results obtained at charge rate of 1 C, discharge rate of 0.5 C, EOCV of 4.0 V and DOD of 0.4 were used to validate the cycle life model. Good agreement between the simulations and the experiments has been achieved up to 1968 cycles.

abstract = {Due to the interconnection and active management of Distributed Generation (DG) and Energy Storage Systems (ESSs), the traditional electrical distribution network has become an Active Distribution Network (ADN), posing challenges to the operation optimization of the network. The power supply and storage capacity indexes of a Local Autonomy Control Region (LACR), which consists of DGs, ESSs and the network, are proposed in this paper to quantify the power regulating range of a LACR. DG/ESS and the network are considered as a whole in the model of the indexes, considering both network constraints and power constraints of the DG/ESS. The index quantifies the maximum LACR power supplied to or received from ADN lines. Similarly, power supply and storage capacity indexes of the ADN line are also proposed to quantify the maximum power exchanged between ADN lines. Then a practical algorithm to calculate the indexes is presented, and an operation optimization model is proposed based on the indexes to maximum the economic benefit of DG/ESS. In the optimization model, the power supply reliability of the ADN line is also considered. Finally, the indexes of power supply and storage capacity and the optimization are demonstrated in a case study.},

This paper describes the application of load control using a novel frequency and voltage-sensing device. The device uses a low cost microcontroller to monitor the system frequency and voltage. Load switching is carried out based on this information. Software was developed for frequency and voltage measurements and tested on a 18 kW, single phase, 50 Hz, micro-hydro system. A fuzzy control system was then developed which makes intelligent load switching decisions using inputs from the measurement algorithms coupled with expert knowledge expressed in the form of control rules. This load control system was then tested on the same micro-hydro system and on a site powered by a 60 kW, 3 phase, 50 Hz wind turbine only.},

It is known that the large-scale integration of DER in conventional low-voltage (LV) networks poses many challenges such as voltage rise. To mitigate voltage rise caused by DER, utilities are defining simple voltage regulation strategies such as disconnecting DER when phase voltages rise above a defined threshold. In this paper, we model LV networks as three-phase unbalanced circuits and illustrate that such local regulation strategies may cause the cascading of the DER in a feeder. We then propose an optimal control approach to avoid cascading and optimize DER availability. Local control approaches are discussed in the context of global DER availability and their limitations are illustrated.},

abstract = {The idea of Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) lies on the fact that heterogeneous Energy Storage System (ESS) technologies have complementary characteristics in terms of power and energy density, life cycle, response rate, and so on. In other words, high power ESS devices possess fast response rate while in the contrary, high energy ESS devices possess slow response rate. Therefore, it may be beneficial to hybridize ESS technologies in the way that synergize functional advantages of two heterogeneous existing ESS technologies As a consequence, this hybridization provides excellent characteristics not offered by a single ESS unit. This new technology has been proposed and investigated by several researchers in the literature particularly in the fields of renewable energy and electrified transport sector. In this context and according to an extensive literature survey, this paper is to review the concept of the HESS, hybridization principles and proposed topologies, power electronics interface architectures, control and energy management strategies, and application arenas.},

The main objective is to obtain maximum EV penetration in the distribution grid without reinforcing the grid in order to avoid any cost for distribution system operators (DSOs). Two smart charging algorithms are proposed in this study. The proposed algorithms are applied to a part of the Danish distribution grid as a case study. As a comparison, a dumb charging scenario, i.e. charging EVs without any specific order or algorithm, is also simulated. Simulation results demonstrate the capability of the smart charging methods to increase the penetration of EVs up to three times, compared to the base case.},

In the past, heterogeneous intelligent systems have been developed to interpret the data and provide information to engineers to assist with the disturbance diagnosis task. The majority of these systems remain standalone due to the problems associated with systems integration. This paper proposes the use of multiagent systems for providing a flexible and scalable alternative to existing integration approaches. A novel multiagent system (MAS) has been developed entitled protection engineering diagnostic agents (PEDA) which integrates a legacy SCADA interpretation system with new systems for digital fault recorder (DFR) record interpretation and for enhancing fault record retrieval from remote DFR's. The use of MAS technology provides a flexible and scalable architecture open to the introduction of new data interpretation systems. The paper discusses the benefits of a multiagent approach and the design and implementation of PEDA.},

Due to the intermittency of the renewable generation and constantly changing load demand, the charging/discharging of various ESSs in an autonomous microgrid needs to be properly coordinated to ensure the supply-demand balance. Recent research has discovered that the charging/discharging efficiency of ESSs has remarkable dependence on the charging/discharging rate and state-of-charge of the ESS. This paper proposes a distributed cooperative control strategy for coordinating the ESSs to maintain the supply-demand balance and minimize the total power loss associated with charging/discharging inefficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by simulation results.},

Integrating an energy storage system (ESS) in a wind farm reduces wind power fluctuations. Various ESS technologies and configurations are viable for this application. This paper examines aggregated and distributed connection topologies of the ESS technologies within the wind farm. The power ratings of the ESSs and their power electronic interfaces are estimated. The abilities of the aggregated and distributed ESSs to improve local voltage and reduce system frequency deviations are evaluated and compared. Simulation results show that the two ESS configurations have effective and similar performance to suppress wind power fluctuations, and thus to improve the power quality. Compared to its distributed counterpart, the aggregated ESS could have a lower power rating due to smoothing effect in a wind farm, but a higher converter VA rating due to the switch count.},

Price uncertainty is modeled through robust optimization techniques. The model materializes into a simple linear programming algorithm that can be easily integrated in the Energy Management System of a household or a small business. A simple bidirectional communication device between the power supplier and the consumer enables the implementation of the proposed model.

abstract = {A large amount of wind power generation capacity is expected to be installed in Great Britain by 2020. A considerable amount of this capacity will be located in Scotland. This will require reinforcement of power transmission capacity between Scotland and England. Analysis of the impact of a large amount of wind generation capacity on the electricity network requires modelling of wind power output. Due to the lack of available wind power output data a method for artificially generating wind power output from real wind speed data was developed. The technique is based on monthly wind speed averages used to generate Weibull distributions. Hourly wind power output time series over one year are generated for 18 onshore and offshore locations in Great Britain. Capacity factors, maxima, minima and hourly output variations, their means and standard deviations are calculated. A comparison of statistical parameters of the generated data with those of real wind power output shows that both have similar statistical properties. The geographically distributed wind power output data is used in conjunction with an optimal load flow model for analysing three network case studies. One case study uses a hypothesised 2020 Great Britain transmission network the other two cases enhance the network with an Eastern and Western HVDC line linking Scotland and England. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of both HVDC lines in reducing wind generation curtailments and operational costs. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Implementing the software in real-life applications and in simulation tools enables research with a high degree of detail and practical relevance. Agent-based programming, therefore, is an important tool for investigating the future power system. To demonstrate the PEV agent behavior, an optimization algorithm is presented and two battery aging methods, as well as their effect on vehicle-to-grid operation, are analyzed. Aging costs based on the depth-of-discharge result in shallow cycles and a strong dependency on driving behavior, because the state-of-charge affects the discharging process. In contrast, aging costs based on energy throughput calculations result in deeper cycles and V2G operation, which is less dependent on driving behavior.},

Also, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operation is devised to control GVs to charge from or discharge to the grid. Simulations of various faults are carried out under different penetration proportions of SMES and V2G power. The results of load angle response and system voltage response are given to illustrate that both SMES and GVs can enhance transient stability of the power grid. Moreover, the simultaneous use of SMES and GVs can further improve the system dynamic performances.},

abstract = {In a smart grid network, demand-side management plays a significant role in allowing consumers, incentivized by utilities, to manage their energy consumption. This can be done through shifting consumption to off-peak hours and thus reducing the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of the electricity system. In this paper, we begin by proposing a demand-side energy consumption scheduling scheme for household appliances that considers a PAR constraint. An initial optimization problem is formulated to mini- mize the energy cost of the consumers through the determination of the optimal usage power and operation time of throttleable and shiftable appliances, respectively. We realize that the acceptance of consumers of these load management schemes is crucial to its success. Hence, we then introduce a multi-objective optimization problem which not only minimizes the energy cost but also mini- mizes the inconvenience posed to consumers. In addition to solving the proposed optimization problems in a centralized manner, two distributed algorithms for the initial and the multi-objective optimization problems are also proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed demand-side energy consumption schedule can provide an effective approach to reducing total energy costs while simultaneously considering PAR constraints and consumers' preferences.

abstract = {This paper studies the technical design criteria for fast charge infrastructure, covering the mobility needs. The infrastructure supplements the residential and public slow charging infrastructure. Two models are designed. The first determines the charging demand, based on current mobility behavior in Flanders. The second model simulates a charge infrastructure that meets the resulting fast charge demand. The energy management is performed by a rule-based control algorithm, that directs the power flows between the fast chargers, the energy storage system, the grid connection, and the photovoltaic installation. There is a clear trade-off between the size of the energy storage system and the power rating of the grid connection. Finally, the simulations indicate that 99.7{\%} of the vehicles visiting the fast charge infrastructure can start charging within 10 minutes with a configuration limited to 5 charging spots, instead of 9 spots when drivers are not willing to wait.},

The conventional approach is based on restoring the frequency and amplitude deviations produced by the local droop controllers by using an MG central controller (MGCC). A distributed networked control system is used in order to implement a distributed secondary control (DSC), thus avoiding its implementation in MGCC. The proposed approach is not only able to restore frequency and voltage of the MG but also ensures reactive power sharing. The distributed secondary control does not rely on a central control, so that the failure of a single unit will not produce the fail down of the whole system. Experimental results are presented to show the feasibility of the DSC. The time latency and data drop-out limits of the communication systems are studied as well.},

abstract = {Electrical power generation is changing dramatically across the world because of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to introduce mixed energy sources. The power network faces great challenges in transmission and distribution to meet demand with unpredictable daily and seasonal variations. Electrical Energy Storage (EES) is recognized as underpinning technologies to have great potential in meeting these challenges, whereby energy is stored in a certain state, according to the technology used, and is converted to electrical energy when needed. However, the wide variety of options and complex characteristic matrices make it difficult to appraise a specific EES technology for a particular application. This paper intends to mitigate this problem by providing a comprehensive and clear picture of the state-of-the-art technologies available, and where they would be suited for integration into a power generation and distribution system. The paper starts with an overview of the operation principles, technical and economic performance features and the current research and development of important EES technologies, sorted into six main categories based on the types of energy stored. Following this, a comprehensive comparison and an application potential analysis of the reviewed technologies are presented.},

abstract = {As low carbon technologies become more pervasive, distribution network operators are looking to support the expected changes in the demands on the low voltage networks through the smarter control of storage devices. Accurate forecasts of demand at the individual household-level, or of small aggregations of households, can improve the peak demand reduction brought about through such devices by helping to plan the most appropriate charging and discharging cycles. However, before such methods can be developed, validation measures which can assess the accuracy and usefulness of forecasts of the volatile and noisy household-level demand are required. In this paper we introduce a new forecast verification error measure that reduces the so-called "double penalty" effect, incurred by forecasts whose features are displaced in space or time, compared to traditional point-wise metrics, such as the Mean Absolute Error, and p-norms in general. The measure that we propose is based on finding a restricted permutation of the original forecast that minimises the point-wise error, according to a given metric. We illustrate the advantages of our error measure using half-hourly domestic household electrical energy usage data recorded by smart meters, and discuss the effect of the permutation restriction. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Institute of Forecasters.},

abstract = {The implementation of smart grids will fundamentally change the approach of assessing and mitigating system voltage deficiencies on an electric distribution system. Many distribution companies have historically identified customer level voltage deficiencies utilizing a reactive approach that relies upon customer complaints. The monitoring capabilities of a smart grid will allow utilities to proactively identify events that exceed the voltage threshold limitations set forth by ANSI Std. C84.1 before they become a concern to end-users. This proactive approach can reduce customer complaints and possibly operational costs. This paper describes an approach for determining voltage threshold limits as a function of duration for proactive voltage investigations utilizing smart grid monitoring equipment. The described approach was applied to a smart grid located in Boulder, Colorado. This paper also describes the results of this two-year study.},

abstract = {In this work, we investigate scheduling problems for electrical energy storage systems and formulate an algorithm that finds an optimal solution with minimal charging cycles in the case of a single device. For the considered problems, the storage system is used to reduce the peaks of the production and consumption within (part of) the electricity distribution grid, while minimizing device wear. The presented mathematical model of the storage systems captures the general characteristic of electrical energy storage devices while omitting the details of the specific technology used to store the energy. In this way, the model can be applied to a wide range of settings. Within the model, the wear of the storage devices is modeled by either: (1) the total energy throughput; or (2) the number of switches between charging and discharging, the so-called charging cycles. For the first case, where the energy throughput determines the device wear, a linear programming formulation is given. For the case where charging cycles are considered, an NP-hardness proof is given for instances with multiple storage devices. Furthermore, several observations about the structure of the problem are given when considering a single device. Using these observations, we develop a polynomial time algorithm of low complexity that determines an optimal solution. Furthermore, the solutions produced by this algorithm also minimize the throughput, next to the charging cycles, of the device. Due to the low complexity, the algorithm can be applied in various decentralized smart grid applications within future electricity distribution grids.},

abstract = {A general formulation of the feeder reconfiguration problem for loss reduction and load balancing is given, and a novel solution method is presented. The solution uses a search over different radial configurations created by considering switchings of the branch exchange type. To guide the search, two different power flow approximation methods with varying degrees of accuracy have been developed and tested. The methods are used to calculate the new power flow in the system after a branch exchange and they make use of the power flow equations developed for radial distribution systems. Both accuracy analysis and the test results show that estimation methods can be used in searches to reconfigure a given system even if the system is not well compensated and reconfiguring involves load transfer between different substations. For load balancing, a load balance index is defined and it is shown that the search and power flow estimation methods developed for power loss reduction can also be used for load balancing since the two problems are similar},

abstract = {A battery management system needs to have an accurate inline estimation of SOC for each individual cell in the battery pack. This estimation process poses challenges after substantial battery aging. This article presents a novel method based on model adaptive extended Kalman filter (MAEKF) to estimate SOC for Li-ion batteries. Sensitivity analysis of the electrical model verifies that the accuracy of SOC estimated by EKF is sensitive to resistors used in the cell's electrical model. In order to get the best estimation, values of resistors are obtained in an optimization process in the MAEKF. This method uses the fact of two sudden changes in the cell's voltage derivative with respect to time while discharging current is constant. These two points are assumed as reference points in which their SOC can be determined from cell's chemistry. The optimization algorithm uses the derivative of the cell's measured terminal voltage to allocate SOC of 92{\%} and 15{\%} for two reference points in the V cell equation and updates cell's electrical model. The algorithm's process is fast and computationally inexpensive, making on-board estimation practical. The obtained results demonstrate that by using this method the estimated SOC error for aged Li-ion cells does not exceed 4{\%}. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In deregulated power systems, distribution network operators (DNO) are responsible for maintaining the proper operation and efficiency of distribution networks. This is achieved traditionally through specific investments in network components. The event of distributed generation (DG) has introduced new challenges to these distribution networks. The role of DG units must be correctly assessed to optimise the overall operating and investment cost for the whole system. However, the distributed generation owners (DGOs) have different objective functions which might be contrary to the objectives of DNO. This study presents a long-term dynamic multi-objective model for planning of distribution networks regarding the benefits of DNO and DGOs. The proposed model simultaneously optimises two objectives, namely the benefits of DNO and DGO and determines the optimal schemes of sizing, placement and specially the dynamics (i.e. timing) of investments on DG units and network reinforcements over the planning period. It also considers the uncertainty of electric load, electricity price and wind turbine power generation using the point estimation method. The effect of benefit sharing is investigated for steering the decisions of DGOs. An efficient two-stage heuristic method is utilised to solve the formulated planning problem and tested on a real large-scale distribution network.},

FEEMD-MEA-MLP/FEEMD-GA-MLP] are proposed for the wind speed accurate multi-step predictions by combining FEEMD (Fast Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition), MEA (Mind Evolutionary Algorithm), GA (Genetic Algorithm) and MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) neural networks. In these two hybrid methods, the FEEMD algorithm is adopted to decompose the original wind speed series into a number of sub-layers and the MLP neural networks optimized by the MEA algorithm and the GA algorithm are built to predict the decomposed wind speed sub-layers, respectively. The innovation of the study is to investigate the promoted percentages of the MLP neural networks by the FEEMD decomposition and the MEA/GA optimization, respectively. The involved forecasting models in the performance comparison in the study include the hybrid FEEMD-MEA-MLP, the hybrid FEEMD -GA-MLP, the hybrid FEEMD-MLP, the hybrid MEA-MLP, the hybrid GA-MLP and the single MLP. Two experimental results show that: (a) among all the involved methods, the hybrid FEEMD-MEA-MLP model has the best forecasting performance; (b) the FEEMD algorithm promotes the performance of the MLP neural networks significantly while the MEA/GA algorithms do not improve the performance of the MLP neural networks significantly; and (c) the hybrid FEEMD-MEA-MLP method and the hybrid FEEMD-GA-MLP method are both effective in the wind speed high-precision predictions.},

abstract = {Optimal power flow (OPF) is considered for microgrids, with the objective of minimizing either the power distribution losses, or, the cost of power drawn from the substation and supplied by distributed generation (DG) units, while effecting voltage regulation. The microgrid is unbalanced, due to unequal loads in each phase and non-equilateral conductor spacings on the distribution lines. Similar to OPF formulations for balanced systems, the considered OPF problem is nonconvex. Nevertheless, a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation technique is advocated to obtain a convex problem solvable in polynomial-time complexity. Enticingly, numerical tests demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to attain the globally optimal solution of the original nonconvex OPF. To ensure scalability with respect to the number of nodes, robustness to isolated communication outages, and data privacy and integrity, the proposed SDP is solved in a distributed fashion by resorting to the alternating direction method of multipliers. The resulting algorithm entails iterative message-passing among groups of consumers and guarantees faster convergence compared to competing alternatives},

abstract = {The main features of the instantaneous reactive power (IRP) p-q theory, considered as a power theory of three-phase systems, are analyzed in this paper using the theory of the currents' physical components (CPC). This analysis shows that the p and q powers are not associated with separate power phenomena, but with multiple phenomena. Moreover, the results of the IRP p-q theory contradict some common interpretations of power phenomena in three-phase circuits. Namely, according to the IRP p-q Theory the instantaneous reactive current can occur even if a load has zero reactive power, Q. Similarly, the instantaneous active current can occur even if a load has zero active power, P. Moreover, these two currents in circuits with a sinusoidal supply voltage can be nonsinusoidal even if there is no source of current distortion in the load. The analysis shows that a pair of values of instantaneous active and reactive p and q powers does not enable us to draw any conclusion with respect to the power properties of three-phase unbalanced loads even in a sinusoidal situation. Thus, the instantaneous reactive power p-q theory does not identify power properties of such loads instantaneously. This conclusion may have an importance for control algorithms of active power filters. The paper reveals the relationship between the p and q powers and the active, reactive and unbalanced powers, P, Q, and D and specifies the required energy storage capability of active power filters operated under sinusoidal unbalanced conditions.},

abstract = {It is difficult to estimate how much distributed generation (DG) capacity will be connected to distribution systems in the coming years; however, it is certain that increasing penetration levels require robust tools that help assess the capabilities and requirements of the networks in order to produce the best planning and control strategies. The work of this Task Force is focused on the numerous strategies and methods that have been developed in recent years to address DG integration and planning. This paper contains a critical review of the work in this field. Although there have been numerous publications in this area, widespread implementation of the methods has not taken place. The barriers to implementation of the advanced techniques are outlined, highlighting why network operators have been slow to pick up on the research to date. Furthermore, key challenges ahead which remain to be tackled are also described, many of which have come into clear focus with the current drive towards smarter distribution networks.},

abstract = {The energy industry has been going through a significant modernization process over the last decade. Its infrastructure is being upgraded rapidly. The supply, demand and prices are becoming more volatile and less predictable than ever before. Even its business model is being challenged fundamentally. In this competitive and dynamic environment, many decision-making processes rely on probabilistic forecasts to quantify the uncertain future. Although most of the papers in the energy forecasting literature focus on point or single-valued forecasts, the research interest in probabilistic energy forecasting research has taken off rapidly in recent years. In this paper, we summarize the recent research progress on probabilistic energy forecasting. A major portion of the paper is devoted to introducing the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 (GEFCom2014), a probabilistic energy forecasting competition with four tracks on load, price, wind and solar forecasting, which attracted 581 participants from 61 countries. We conclude the paper with 12 predictions for the next decade of energy forecasting.},

abstract = {Legacy substation automation protocols and architectures typically provided basic functionality for power system automation and were designed to accommodate the technical limitations of the networking technology available for implementation. There has recently been a vast improvement in networking technology that has changed dramatically what is now feasible for power system automation in the substation. Technologies such as switched Ethernet, TCP/IP, high-speed wide area networks, and high-performance low-cost computers are providing capabilities that could barely be imagined when most legacy substation automation protocols were designed. In order to take advantage of modern technology to deliver additional new benefits to users of substation automation, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has developed and released a new global standard for substation automation: IEC 61850. The paper will provide a basic technical overview of IEC 61850 and will discuss the benefits of each major aspect of the standard. The concept of a virtual model comprising both physical and logical device models that includes a set of standardized communications services will be described along with explanations of how these standardized models, object naming conventions, and communication services bring significant benefits to the substation automation user. New services to support self-describing devices and object-orient peer-to-peer data exchange will be explained with an emphasis on how these services can be applied to reduce costs for substation automation. The substation configuration language (SCL) of IEC 61850 will be presented with information on how the standardization of substation configuration will impact the future of substation automation. The paper will conclude with a brief introduction to the UCA International Users Group as a forum where users and suppliers cooperate in improving substation automation with testing, education, and demonstrations of IEC 61850 -$\backslash$nand other IEC standards technology},

Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems using the battery storages of electric vehicles could provide power system ancillary services in the form of power balancing reserves to support the large-scale integration of variable renewable energy sources like wind power. This paper investigates the dynamic frequency response of an islanded Danish distribution system operation with large amount of wind power supported by the Vehicle-to-grid systems. The power system simulations are analysed for scenarios with 48{\%} and 65{\%} of wind power penetration. The simulation results show that the V2G systems provide a faster and stable frequency control than the conventional generation units. V2G systems can be considered as a flexible solution for frequency regulation in future electric power systems.},

abstract = {A large-scale power grid's ability to transfer energy from producers to consumers is constrained by both the network structure and the nonlinear physics of power flow. Violations of these constraints have been observed to result in voltage collapse blackouts, where nodal voltages slowly decline before precipitously falling. However, methods to test for voltage collapse are dominantly simulation-based, offering little theoretical insight into how grid structure influences stability margins. For a simplified power flow model, here we derive a closed-form condition under which a power network is safe from voltage collapse. The condition combines the complex structure of the network with the reactive power demands of loads to produce a node-by-node measure of grid stress, a prediction of the largest nodal voltage deviation, and an estimate of the distance to collapse. We extensively test our predictions on large-scale systems, highlighting how our condition can be leveraged to increase grid stability margins.},

A decentralized multi-agent based protection with capability of HIF detection, fault location and load shedding for the DG systems is proposed in the paper. Digital relay is designed as a relay agent which is capable of searching for information from other relay agents, interacting with other relay agents and performing tasks of protection with autonomy and cooperating. The agent based protection scheme is also presented. EMTP simulation results show that the proposed agent based protection scheme can remove the influence of load switching operations, protect against HIF, electric shock.

abstract = {Abstract Electric vehicles (EVs) represent one of the most promising technologies to green the transportation systems. An important issue is that high penetration of EVs brings heavy electricity demand to the power grid. One effective way to alleviate the impact is to integrate local power generation such as renewable energy sources (RESs) into charging infrastructure. Because of the intermittent and indispatchable nature of RESs, it becomes very challenging to coordinate EVs charging with other grid load and renewable generation. In this paper, EVs charging problem in the presence of smart grid technologies is investigated, and the interaction with renewable energy is reviewed. An overview about EVs and RESs is first presented, which mainly introduces major types of EVs and renewable energy estimation methods. Then, according to the objectives, the existing research works are divided into three categories: cost-aware, efficiency-aware, and emissions-aware interactions between EVs and RESs. Each category's discussion includes the description of core ideas, summarization of solutions, and comparison between different works. Finally, some key open issues about EVs interacting with RESs are given and some possible solutions are also discussed.},

abstract = {Starting with the Computer Business Equipment Manufacturers' Association acceptability curves, a procedure for quantifying the voltage quality is proposed. It is based on using the reciprocal of the permissible time duration for each value of the customer voltage. Since the magnitude of the voltage at any network bus changes with time depending on the load curve, the daily average value of the above suggested voltage quality index will provide a suitable figure of merit for the quality assessment. The analysis starts with the derivation of an analytical expression of the voltage quality index, denoted as voltage penalty function, in terms of the voltage. Then, relations are presented for the dependence of this index on the network as well as of the load parameters. Special interest is given to the load factor, the load power factor, its peak value, and the short-circuit level of the power network. The impact of eventual shunt compensation (and its level) on the voltage quality is discussed for both permanently connected capacitors, and for those which are switched only for a certain duration. In the latter case, the effect of the capacitor switching time point is demonstrated. The compensation level, the time point of application, and its duration are the three parameters for which a detailed sensitivity analysis and optimization for the least voltage daily average penalty are conducted. The applicability of the suggested procedure to nonrepeated events in distribution networks is also addressed. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

In the study, a power system simulation tool, namely PSCAD, is used to model two generic LV networks, BIPV systems and an ESS in order to simulate the performance of the networks with various levels of BIPV penetrations. A control algorithm is developed and implemented in the energy storage model in order to study the ability of the ESS to mitigate network voltage unbalance and reduce losses. Experimental studies are carried out in the experimental small-scale energy zone to investigate the effectiveness of the energy storage system under various levels of PV penetration and load conditions. The simulation and experimental studies carried out clearly show the effectiveness of the ESS in reducing the voltage unbalance factor and improving the efficiency of the two networks considered.},

abstract = {In this paper, a heuristic backtracking search algorithm is proposed to adjust the phasing arrangement of primary feeders and laterals for phase balancing of distribution systems. The phase unbalance index of distribution feeders is calculated based on the phasing current magnitude of each line segment and branch, which has been solved by a three-phase load flow program. The database of an automated mapping/ facility management (AM/FM) system is used to retrieve the component attributes, and the topology process is executed to determine the electrical network configuration and the customers served by each distribution transformer. By using the monthly energy consumption of customers in customer information system (CIS) and the typical daily load patterns of customer classes, the hourly loading profiles of distribution transformers and service zones can be derived to solve the individual phase loadings of each primary feeder and lateral. The phase balancing of distribution systems is enhanced by heuristic rule-based searching process to minimize the phase unbalance index. To demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed methodology, a practical distribution feeder with 2754 customers is selected for computer simulation to enhance three-phase balancing of distribution systems. It is concluded that three-phase balancing of distribution systems can be obtained by considering customer load characteristics. {\&}copy; 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {The scope of this study is the optimal siting and sizing of distributed generation within a power distribution network considering uncertainties. A probabilistic power flow (PPF)-embedded genetic algorithm (GA)-based approach is proposed in order to solve the optimisation problem that is modelled mathematically under a chance constrained programming framework. Point estimate method (PEM) is proposed for the solution of the involved PPF problem. The uncertainties considered include: (i) the future load growth in the power distribution system, (ii) the wind generation, (iii) the output power of photovoltaics, (iv) the fuel costs and (v) the electricity prices. Based on some candidate schemes of different distributed generation types and sizes, placed on specific candidate buses of the network, GA is applied in order to find the optimal plan. The proposed GA with embedded PEM (GA-PEM) is applied on the IEEE 33-bus network by considering several scenarios and is compared with the method of GA with embedded Monte Carlo simulation (GA-MCS). The main conclusions of this comparison are: (i) the proposed GA-PEM is seven times faster than GA-MCS, and (ii) both methods provide almost identical results.},

In this study, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework based evaluation of such a smart household is provided. Electric vehicles (EVs) with bi-directional power flow capability via charging and V2H operating modes, energy storage systems (ESSs) with peak clipping and valley filling opportunity and a small scale distributed generation (DG) unit enabling energy sell back to grid are all considered in the evaluated smart household structure. Different case studies including also different DR strategies based on dynamic pricing and peak power limiting are conducted to evaluate the technical and economic impacts of ESS and DG units. Besides, shiftable loads such as washing machine and dishwasher are also considered in Home Energy Management (HEM) system structure for the effective operation of the household. Moreover, a further sensitivity analysis is realized in order to discuss the impact of ESS and DG sizing on daily cost of smart household operation considering further pros and cons. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper proposes a novel approach to monthly electric energy demand time series forecasting, in which it is split into two new series: the trend and the fluctuation around it. Then two neural networks are trained to forecast them separately. These predictions are added up to obtain an overall forecasting. Several methods have been tested to find out which of them provides the best performance in the trend extraction. The proposed technique has been applied to the Spanish peninsular monthly electric consumption. The results obtained are better than those reached when only one neural network was used to forecast the original consumption series and also than those obtained with the ARIMA method.},

abstract = {Coordinated charging can provide efficient charging plans for electric vehicles (EVs) to improve the overall energy utilization while preventing an electric power system from overloading. However, designing an efficient coordinated charging strategy to route mobile EVs to fast-charging stations for globally optimal energy utilization is very challenging. In this paper, we investigate a special smart grid with enhanced communication capabilities, i.e., a VANET-enhanced smart grid. It exploits vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to support real-time communications among road-side units (RSUs) and highly mobile EVs for collecting real-time vehicle mobility information or dispatching charging decisions. Then, we propose a mobility-aware coordinated charging strategy for EVs, which not only improves the overall energy utilization while avoiding power system overloading, but also addresses the range anxieties of individual EVs by reducing the average travel cost. Specifically, the mobility-incurred travel cost for an EV is considered in two aspects: 1) the travel distance from the current position of the EV to a charging station; and 2) the transmission delay for receiving a charging decision via VANETs. The optimal mobility-aware coordinated EV charging problem is formulated as a time-coupled mixed-integer linear programming problem. By solving this problem based on Lagrange duality and branch-and-bound-based outer approximation techniques, an efficient charging strategy is obtained. To evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy, a realistic suburban scenario is developed in VISSIM to track vehicle mobility through the generated simulation traces, based on which the travel cost of each EV can be accurately calculated. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy considerably outperforms the traditional EV charging strategy without VANETs on the metrics of the overall energy utilization, the average EV travel cost, and the number of successfu- ly charged EVs.},

abstract = {This paper presents a single-stage, three-phase grid connected solar photovoltaic (SPV) system. The proposed system is dual purpose, as it not only feeds extracted solar energy into the grid but it also helps in improving power quality in the distribution system. The presented system serves the purpose of maximum power point tracking (MPPT), feeding SPV energy to the grid, harmonics mitigation of loads connected at point of common coupling (PCC) and balancing the grid currents. The SPV system uses a three-phase voltage source converter (VSC) for performing all these functions. An improved linear sinusoidal tracer (ILST)-based control algorithm is proposed for control of VSC. In the proposed system, a variable dc link voltage is used for MPPT. An instantaneous compensation technique is used incorporating changes in PV power for fast dynamic response. The SPV system is first simulated in MATLAB along with Simulink and sim-power system toolboxes, and simulated results are verified experimentally. The proposed SPV system and its control algorithm are implemented in a three-phase distribution system for power quality improvement and improved utilization of VSC. The total harmonics distortions (THDs) of grid currents and PCC voltages are observed within IEEE-929 and IEEE-519 standards.},

The fitness evaluation function that drives the GA to the solution is the relation between the benefit obtained by the installation of DG units and the investment and operational costs incurred in their installation. The losses and voltage profile evaluation is based on a power flow method for radial networks with the representation of dispersed generators.

The idea is to integrate the DG unit functions with shunt active power filter capabilities. With this approach, the inverter controls the active power flow from the renewable energy source to the grid and also performs the nonlinear load current harmonic compensation by keeping the grid current almost sinusoidal. The control scheme employs a current reference generator based on sinusoidal signal integrator and instantaneous reactive power (IRP) theory together with a dedicated repetitive current controller.

abstract = {Innovations in electricity infrastructure of today's Smart Grid will allow distributed renewable resources to provide transmission level support when combined with new energy storage technology. The modernization of the existing grid requires the implementation of controls and communication architecture that are capable of coordinating as available resources such as wind generation, energy storage and loads in order to improve the efficient and economic operation of the electric power distribution system. Integration of energy storage systems into the Smart Grid can manage the real power variability of wind generation by providing ramp rate variation control and frequency regulation via droop control response. These control features drastically increase reliability of the Smart Grid, enables more effective grid management. Operational issues raised by the variability and high ramping characteristics of wind generation can be mitigated with the integration of battery energy storage systems. This paper presents several control methodologies for battery energy storage systems. Results are discussed particularly with respect to developing better insight into the dynamic performance of such resources and how to manage problems associated with the viability in real power output of wind generation.},

abstract = {Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) can be utilized to shave the peak load in power systems and thus defer the need to upgrade the power grid. Based on a rolling load forecasting method, along with the peak load reduction requirements in reality, at the planning level, we propose a BESS capacity planning model for peak and load shaving problem. At the operational level, we consider the optimal control policy towards charging and discharging power with two different optimization objectives: one is to diminish the difference between the peak load and the valley load, the other is to minimize the daily load variance. Particularly, the constraint of charging and discharging cycles, which is an important issue in practice, is taken into consideration. Finally, based on real load data, we provide simulation results that validate the proposed optimization models and control strategies.},

abstract = {Summary form only given. In the paper a new approach to adaptive underfrequency load shedding, a procedure for protecting electric power systems from dynamic instability and frequency collapse is presented. It consists of two main stages. In the first stage, the frequency and the rate of frequency change are estimated by the nonrecursive Newton type algorithm. By using the simplest expression of the generator swing equation, in the second algorithm stage the magnitude of the disturbance is determined. The underfrequency load shedding plan is adapted to the magnitude estimated, obtaining in this way a more efficient system operation during emergency conditions. Results of procedure testing are demonstrated through the dynamic simulations by using: a) a simple 3-machines test system and b) a 10-machines New England system.},

abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) may soon enter the vehicle market in large numbers and change the overall fuel usage within the passenger transport sector. With increased variable consumption from EVs together with anticipated increased production from variable sources, due to renewable wind and solar power, also the balancing of the electric power system incur increased attention. This emphasizes the importance of developing models to estimate and investigate the stochasticity of personal car travel behavior and induced EV charging load. Several studies have been made in order to model the stochasticity of passenger car travel behavior but none have captured the charging behavior dependence of the type-of-trip conducted. This paper proposes a new model for plug-in-hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) utilization and recharging price sensitivity, to determine charging load profiles based on driving patterns due to the type-of-trip and corresponding charging need. This approach makes it possible to relate the type-of-trip with the consumption level, the parking location, and the charging opportunity. The proposed model is applied in a case study using Swedish car travel data. The results show the charging load impact and variation due to the stochastic PHEV type-of-trip mobility, allowing quantification of the PHEV charging impact on the system.},

Specifically, for two datasets, the performance of Support Vector Regression (SVR), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Genetic Programming (GP), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Echo State Networks (ESNs), and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) are compared adopting common evaluation criteria. Concerning the datasets, the Almanac of Minutely Power Dataset (AMPds) is used to compute predictions with domestic consumption, 2 year of recordings, and to perform further evaluations with the available heterogeneous data, such as energy and temperature. Whereas, predictions of building consumption are performed with the datasets recorded at the Department for International Development (DFID). In addition, the results achieved for the previous release of the AMPds, 1 year of recordings, are also reported, in order to evaluate the impact of seasonality in forecasting performance. Finally, the achieved results validate the suitability of ANN, SVR and ELM approaches for prediction applications in small-grid scenario. Specifically, for the domestic consumption the best performance are achieved by SVR and ANN, for natural gas and water, respectively. Whereas, the ANN shows the best results for both water and natural gas forecasting in building scenario.},

abstract = {Three phase battery energy storage (BES) installed in the residential low voltage (LV) distribution network can provide functions such as peak shaving and valley filling (i.e. charge when demand is low and discharge when demand is high), load balancing (i.e. charge more from phases with lower loads and discharge more to phases with higher loads) and management of distributed renewable energy generation (i.e. charge when rooftop solar photovoltaics are generating). To accrue and enable these functions an intelligent scheduling system was developed. The scheduling system can reliably schedule the charge and discharge cycles and operate the BES in real time. The scheduling system is composed of three integrated modules: (1) a load forecast system to generate next-day load profile forecasts; (2) a scheduler to derive an initial charge and discharge schedule based on load profile forecasts; and (3) an online control algorithm to mitigate forecast error through continuous schedule adjustments. The scheduling system was applied to an LV distribution network servicing 128 residential customers located in an urban region of South East Queensland, Australia.},

The simulation builds on over 11{\$}thinspace{\$}400 empirical driving profiles from a German mobility panel and applies technical specifications of three currently available EVs. This allows for a realistic analysis of the applicability of smart charging and V2G as well as the extent to which EVs are capable to fulfill current driving needs. Results show that smart charging strategies will reduce charging cost on average by more than 32{\%} in all analyzed cases. V2G could provide additional revenue for EV owners with shorter trip patterns while reducing electricity cost for others.},

abstract = {The global effort to decarbonise electricity systems has led to widespread deployments of variable renewable energy generation technologies, which in turn has boosted research and development interest in bulk Electrical Energy Storage (EES). However despite large increases in research funding, many electricity markets with increasingly large proportions of variable renewable generation have seen little actual bulk EES deployment. While this can be partly attributed to the need for technological developments, it is also due to the challenge of fairly rewarding storage operators for the range of services that storage provides to the wider network, especially in markets that have undergone significant restructuring and liberalisation. Pumped Hydroelectric Energy Storage (PHES) is the overwhelmingly established bulk EES technology (with a global installed capacity around 130 GW) and has been an integral part of many markets since the 1960s. This review provides an historical overview of the development of PHES in several significant electrical markets and compares a number of mechanisms that can reward PHES in different international market frameworks. As well as providing up-to-date information about PHES, a primary motivation for this work is to provide an overview about the types of rewards available to bulk EES for the wider storage community including investors, technology developers and policy-makers. Observing that bulk EES projects seem to be unattractive investments for the private sector, the paper also includes a brief discussion in terms of public sector investment.},

This may be done by using the virtual power plant (VPP) concept, which consists of aggregating the capacity of many distributed energy resources (DER) in order to make them more accessible and manageable across energy markets. This paper provides an optimization algorithm to manage a VPP composed of a large number of customers with thermostatically controlled appliances. The algorithm, based on a direct load control (DLC), determines the optimal control schedules that an aggregator should apply to the controllable devices of the VPP in order to optimize load reduction over a specified control period. The results define the load reduction bid that the aggregator can present in the electricity market, thus helping to minimize network congestion and deviations between generation and demand. The proposed model, which is valid for both transmission and distribution networks, is tested on a real power system to demonstrate its applicability.},

abstract = {This paper develops a strategy to coordinate the charging of autonomous plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) using concepts from non-cooperative games. The foundation of the paper is a model that assumes PEVs are cost-minimizing and weakly coupled via a common electricity price. At a Nash equilibrium, each PEV reacts optimally with respect to a commonly observed charging trajectory that is the average of all PEV strategies. This average is given by the solution of a fixed point problem in the limit of infinite population size. The ideal solution minimizes electricity generation costs by scheduling PEV demand to fill the overnight non-PEV demand "valley". The paper's central theoretical result is a proof of the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium that almost satisfies that ideal. This result is accompanied by a decentralized computational algorithm and a proof that the algorithm converges to the Nash equilibrium in the infinite system limit. Several numerical examples are used to illustrate the performance of the solution strategy for finite populations. The examples demonstrate that convergence to the Nash equilibrium occurs very quickly over a broad range of parameters, and suggest this method could be useful in situations where frequent communication with PEVs is not possible. The method is useful in applications where fully centralized control is not possible, but where optimal or near-optimal charging patterns are essential to system operation.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the charging of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) in an existing office building microgrid equipped with a photovoltaic (PV) system and a combined heat and power (CHP) unit. Different charging strategies and charging power ratings for workplace charging are examined for their grid impact and their impact on the self-consumption of the locally generated electricity. The grid impact can be significantly reduced by using strategies that require limited future knowledge of the EV mobility behavior and limited communication infrastructure. These strategies allow a high number of EVs to be charged at an office building, even with a limited number of charging spots, due to the large standstill times.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss consensus problems for networks of dynamic agents with fixed and switching topologies. We analyze three cases: 1) directed networks with fixed topology; 2) directed networks with switching topology; and 3) undirected networks with communication time-delays and fixed topology. We introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. We establish a direct connection between the algebraic connectivity (or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. This required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. It turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus problems. We introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. A disagreement function is a Lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. We proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common Lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. A distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks with directed information flow. We provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. Simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

abstract = {This guide describes a high-level, technology-neutral framework for assessing potential benefits from and economic market potential for energy storage used for electric-utility-related applications. The overarching theme addressed is the concept of combining applications/benefits into attractive value propositions that include use of energy storage, possibly including distributed and/or modular systems. Other topics addressed include: high-level estimates of application-specific lifecycle benefit (10 years) in /kW and maximum market potential (10 years) in MW. Combined, these criteria indicate the economic potential (in Millions) for a given energy storage application/benefit. The benefits and value propositions characterized provide an important indication of storage system cost targets for system and subsystem developers, vendors, and prospective users. Maximum market potential estimates provide developers, vendors, and energy policymakers with an indication of the upper bound of the potential demand for storage. The combination of the value of an individual benefit (in /kW) and the corresponding maximum market potential estimate (in MW) indicates the possible impact that storage could have on the U.S. economy. The intended audience for this document includes persons or organizations needing a framework for making first-cut or high-level estimates of benefits for a specific storage project and/or those seeking a high-level estimate of viable price points and/or maximum market potential for their products. Thus, the intended audience includes: electric utility planners, electricity end users, non-utility electric energy and electric services providers, electric utility regulators and policymakers, intermittent renewables advocates and developers, Smart Grid advocates and developers, storage technology and project developers, and energy storage advocates.},

In the past, heterogeneous intelligent systems have been developed to interpret the data and provide information to engineers to assist with the disturbance diagnosis task. The majority of these systems remain standalone due to the problems associated with systems integration. This paper proposes the use of multiagent systems for providing a flexible and scalable alternative to existing integration approaches. A novel multiagent system (MAS) has been developed entitled protection engineering diagnostic agents (PEDA) which integrates a legacy SCADA interpretation system with new systems for digital fault recorder (DFR) record interpretation and for enhancing fault record retrieval from remote DFR's. The use of MAS technology provides a flexible and scalable architecture open to the introduction of new data interpretation systems. The paper discusses the benefits of a multiagent approach and the design and implementation of PEDA.},

The scheme charges the battery during instances of low load and discharges during peak load using only locally available data. The scheme is also capable of adapting to changes in load behaviour throughout the year and is capable of identifying whether local load is dependent on the working week. The scheme is verified both in the small-signal environment and in the steady-state load flow environment using MATLAB. Two case studies covering a typical residential and commercial load profile are conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {Metaheuristics algorithms are widely recognized as one of most practical approaches for combinatorial optimization problems. One the most interesting areas of application are the power systems. In particular, Distribution Systems planning and operation. This paper presents some metaheuristics approaches to solve a typical combinatorial optimization problem: the Phase Balancing in Low Voltage Electric Distribution Systems. A model supported in Linear Integer-Mixed Programming is presented, to observe and discussing its limitations. From this, is introduced a new metaheuristic, called Fuzzy Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization, based in the Swarm Intelligence Principles and Evolution Strategies, which is extended to fuzzy domain to modeling a multi-objective optimization, by mean of a fuzzy fitness function. A simulation on a real system is presented, and advantages of this approach respect to the Classical Simulated Annealing and Particle Swarm metaheuristics, selected between the most representatives, are evidenced.},

abstract = {Operation of distributed generators in microgrids has widely been discussed, but would not be fully autonomous, if distributed storages are not considered. Storages in general are important, since they provide energy buffering to load changes, energy leveling to source variations and ride-through enhancement to the overall microgrids. Recognizing their importance, this paper presents a scheme for sharing power among multiple distributed storages, in coordination with the distributed sources and loads. The scheme prompts the storages to autonomously sense for system conditions, requesting for maximum charging energy only when excess generation capacity is available. As generation capacity drops or demand increases, energy drawn by the storages decreases spontaneously, until full source capacity is near. At which point, the storages release their stored energy for meeting the extra load demand. The described process takes place in an automated manner with energy sharing always maintained among the storages. To verify the concepts discussed, simulation was performed with its results shown near to the end of the paper.},

@article{Liang2013,
abstract = {In this paper, we study the optimal energy delivery problem from viewpoints of both the vehicle owner and aggregator, in load shaving services of a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system. We formulate the optimization problem based on a general plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) model, taking into account the randomness in vehicle mobility, time-of-use electricity pricing, and realistic battery modeling. Stochastic inventory theory is applied to analyze the problem. We mathematically prove that a state-dependent (S,S) policy is optimal for the daily energy cost minimization of each vehicle, and develop an estimation algorithm to calculate the parameters of the optimal policy for practical applications. Furthermore, we investigate the multi-vehicle aggregator design problem by considering the power system constraints. A policy adjustment scheme is proposed to adjust the values of S and S with respect to the optimal policy adopted by each PHEV, such that the aggregated recharging and discharging power constraints of the power system can be satisfied, while minimizing the incremental cost (or revenue loss) of PHEV owners. Based on characteristics of the state-dependent (S,S) policy and our proposed policy adjustment scheme, the optimal aggregator operation problem is transformed into a convex optimization one which can be readily solved by existing algorithms. The performance of our proposed schemes is evaluated via simulations based on real data collected from Canadian utilities, households, and commuters. 2013 IEEE.},

@article{McKenna2017,
abstract = {Adequately accounting for interactions between Low Carbon Technologies (LCTs) at the building level and the overarching energy system means capturing the granularity associated with decentralised heat and power supply in residential buildings. This paper combines dwelling/household archetypes (DHAs) combined with a mixed integer linear program to generate optimal (minimum cost) technology configurations and operation schedules for individual dwellings. These DHAs are scaled up to three socioeconomically differentiated neighbourhood clusters at the Output Area level in the UK. A synthetic distribution network generation and simulation assesses the required network upgrade costs for these clusters with different LCT penetration scenarios. Whilst the application here is to the United Kingdom (UK) setting, the method is largely based on freely available data and is therefore highly transferable to other contexts. The results show significant differences between the upgrade costs of the three analysed network types, and especially the semi-rural cluster has much higher costs. The employment of heat pumps together with photovoltaics (PV) has strong synergy effects, which can considerably reduce the network upgrade and carbon abatement costs if deployed in parallel. The determined CO2-abatement costs also suggest that decarbonisation measures with these two technologies should focus on semi-urban neighbourhoods due to the lower cost in comparison to the semi-rural case. This shows that such a socioeconomically differentiated approach to distribution network modelling can provide useful energy policy insights.},

abstract = {A large penetration of electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles would likely result in increased system peaks and overloading of power system assets if the charging of vehicles is left uncontrolled. In this paper we propose both a centralized and a decentralized smart-charging scheme which seek to minimize system-wide generation costs while respecting grid constraints. Under the centralized scheme, vehicles' batteries are aggregated to virtual storage resources at each network node, which are optimally dispatched with a multiperiod Optimal Power Flow. On the other hand, under the decentralized scheme, price profiles broadcasted to vehicles day-ahead are determined so that the optimal response of individual vehicles to this tariff achieves the goal of cost minimization. Two alternative tariffs are explored, one where the same price profile applies system-wide, and another where different prices can be defined at different nodes. Results show that compared with uncontrolled charging, these smart-charging schemes successfully avoid asset overloading, displace most charging to valley hours and reduce generation costs. Moreover they are robust in the face of forecast errors in vehicle behavior.},

The approach is discussed in the perspective of effectiveness and ade- quacy. Its consequences toDNOcontrol effort are evaluated.

abstract = {Grid integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) is increasing rapidly. Furthermore, smart grid technologies are making the grid more bi-directional providing opportunities to consumers to supply power back to the grid. Energy storage technologies like battery and ultracapacitor (UCAP) can be integrated through grid-tied inverters to support variable DERs such as solar and wind. In these cases, the energy storage with active power capability can improve grid performance by providing active and reactive power support. In this paper, the concept of providing active/reactive power support and renewable intermittency smoothing to the distribution grid by UCAPs is presented. UCAPs have a higher number of charge-discharge cycles and higher terminal voltage per module when compared to batteries which make them ideal for providing grid support. The UCAP is integrated into the dc-link of the active power filter (APF) through a dc-dc converter. The dc-dc converter provides a stiff dc-link voltage which improves the performance of the grid tied-inverter. Design and control of both the dc-ac inverter and the dc-dc converter are very important in this regard and presented. The simulation model of the overall system is developed and results are compared to the results from an experimental hardware setup.},

As a result, the current electricity infrastructure is expected to evolve into a network of networks, in which all system parts communicate with each other and influence each other. Multi-agent systems and electronic markets form an appropriate technology needed for control and coordination tasks in the future electricity network. We present the PowerMatcher, a market-based control concept for supply and demand matching (SDM) in electricity networks. In a presented simulation study is shown that the simultaneousness of electricity production and consumption can be raised substantially using this concept. Further, we present a field test with medium-sized electricity producing and consuming installations controlled via this concept, currently in preparation.},

abstract = {This paper illustrates how a multiagent system (MAS)-based scheme can be developed for a control/optimization problem. The prototype problem considered is the dispatching of distributed generators on a distribution feeder to provide voltage support. The popular control net protocol (CNP) for MAS has been adopted to facilitate distributed control. This paper illustrates that characterization of the optimal solution is necessary in order to develop a protocol for the MAS to implement. This paper also shows that MAS facilitates a model-free control procedure, as it can monitor the local sensitivities. Test results, based on simulations on a prototype feeder, show that the proposed MAS-based control scheme is very effective in obtaining the solution for the prototype problem. The proposed method needs fast communication among the distributed generators (DGs) in order to assure fast response during emergency conditions. Communication requirements have also been identified in this paper},

It is assumed that the compensator is connected to a load that may either be connected in star or in delta. The load can be unbalanced and may also draw harmonic currents. The purpose of the compensating scheme is to balance the load, as well as make the supply side power factor a desired value. The authors use the theory of instantaneous symmetrical components to obtain an algorithm to compute three phase reference currents which, when injected to the power system, produce desired results. They also propose a suitable compensator structure that will track the reference currents in a hysteresis band control scheme. Finally, the feasibility of such a scheme is demonstrated through simulation studies},

abstract = {Wind power is gaining in significance as an important renewable source of clean energy. However, due to their inherent uncertainty, wind generators are often unable to participate in the forward electricity markets like the more predictable and controllable conventional generators. Given this, virtual power plants (VPPs) are being advocated as a solution for increasing the reliability of such intermittent renewable sources. In this paper, we take this idea further by considering VPPs as coalitions of wind generators and electric vehicles, where wind generators seek to use electric vehicles (EVs) as a storage medium to overcome the vagaries of generation. Using electric vehicles in this manner has the advantage that, since the number of EVs is increasing rapidly, no initial investment in dedicated storage is needed. In more detail, we first formally model the VPP and then, through an operational model based on linear programming, we show how the supply to the Grid and storage in the EV batteries can be scheduled to increase the profit of the VPP, while also paying for the storage using a novel scheme. The feasibility of our approach is examined through a realistic case-study, using real wind power generation data, corresponding electricity market prices and electric vehicles' characteristics.},

Two different technologies, photovoltaic panels (PV) and electric heat pumps (EHP) are studied for different penetration levels by using a real three-phase four-wire LV network in the North West of England. Profiles of loads, PV and EHP have a granularity of 30 minutes. Energy losses, voltage problems and thermal loading are studied. A Monte Carlo approach is considered in order to cater for the random nature of some parameters such as the location and size of low carbon technologies. Results for the studied LV network clearly indicate that meshed operation can indeed increase its ability to host higher penetrations of PV and EHP.},

abstract = {Balanced three-phase four-wire distribution grids can host significantly more distributed generation and electric vehicles. Three-phase photovoltaic (PV) inverters and electric vehicle (EV) chargers can be adapted to transfer power from highly loaded to less loaded phases, without overloading the inverter or charger. Grid conditions will be improved due to a more balanced operation of the network and more PV panels and EVs can be connected before the limits of the network are reached. A classic coordinated charging strategy for EVs is adapted in this paper. It is shown that the charging of EVs can be improved when power can be transferred from one phase to another. Using PV inverters with a balancing inverter, the power injected in each phase will become a controllable variable as the total amount of produced power does not necessarily need to be equally divided across the three phases. The improvements made by using EV chargers and PV inverters that can balance the network are investigated. Several load flow simulations with realistic data show a positive effect on the system losses, the grid voltage, and voltage unbalance. Finally, a local controller is proposed to control the balancing between the phases when a real-time communication channel is not available.},

@article{Ma2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.Uneven load distribution leads to a 3-phase imbalance at the low voltage (LV) substation level. This imbalance has distinct impacts on main feeders and LV transformers: for main feeders, it reduces the available capacity as the phase with the least spare capacity determines the usable capacity; for LV transformers, phase imbalance reduces the available capacity due to additional power along the neutral line. To assess the additional reinforcement cost (ARC) arising from a 3-phase imbalance, this paper proposes two novel costing models for main feeders and LV transformers respectively. Each model involves the derivation of an accurate ARC formula based on the degree of three-phase imbalance and a linearized approximation through Taylor's expansion to simplify the detailed ARC formula, enabling quantification of future LV investment in scale. The developed models are tested on 4 cases where imbalance ranges from 0 to 10{\%}, and reveals that i) a small imbalance degree may cause a substantial ARC on main feeders; ii) ARC grows exponentially as asset utilization is close to its capacity; and that iii) a main feeder is more sensitive to its respective imbalance degree than an LV transformer under the same condition. The models serve as an effective tool to assist distribution network operators (DNOs) to quantify a key cost (ARC) element from the phase imbalance, allowing DNOs to evaluate their future LV investment in scale.},

abstract = {Utility distribution systems are becoming increasingly intelligent, with continued advancements in sensors, monitoring, and controls. In some cases, these improvements make it possible for the utility to isolate faults and reenergize sections of line from alternative points of feed. Under normal circumstances, utilities may dynamically reconfigure their system to optimize overall operating efficiency. With these capabilities comes increased need for detailed three phase models of the distribution system that identify existing equipment and loads on a per-phase basis. This granularity is needed in order to make informed decisions regarding distribution switching, optimization, and control. This paper presents a technique and preliminary test results for a method of automatically identifying the phase of each customer by correlating voltage information from the utility's SCADA system with voltage information from customer electricity meters.},

abstract = {In this paper, a heuristic backtracking search algorithm is proposed to adjust the phasing arrangement of primary feeders and laterals for phase balancing of distribution systems. The phase unbalance index of distribution feeders is calculated based on the phasing current magnitude of each line segment and branch, which has been solved by a three-phase load flow program. The database of an automated mapping/ facility management (AM/FM) system is used to retrieve the component attributes, and the topology process is executed to determine the electrical network configuration and the customers served by each distribution transformer. By using the monthly energy consumption of customers in customer information system (CIS) and the typical daily load patterns of customer classes, the hourly loading profiles of distribution transformers and service zones can be derived to solve the individual phase loadings of each primary feeder and lateral. The phase balancing of distribution systems is enhanced by heuristic rule-based searching process to minimize the phase unbalance index. To demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed methodology, a practical distribution feeder with 2754 customers is selected for computer simulation to enhance three-phase balancing of distribution systems. It is concluded that three-phase balancing of distribution systems can be obtained by considering customer load characteristics. {\&}copy; 2005 IEEE.},

@article{Siti2007,
abstract = {To get the distribution network to operate at its optimum performance in an automated distribution system reconfiguration was been proposed and researched. Considering, however, that optimum performance implies minimum loss, no overloading of transformers and cables, correct voltage profile, and absence of phase voltage and current imbalances, network reconfiguration alone is insufficient. It has to be complemented with techniques for phase rearrangement between the distribution transformer banks and the specific primary feeder with a radial structure and dynamic phase and load balancing along a feeder with a radial structure. This paper contributes such a technique at the low-voltage and medium-voltage levels of a distribution network simultaneously with reconfiguration at both levels. While the neural network is adopted for the network reconfiguration problem, this paper introduces a heuristic method for the phase balancing/loss minimization problem. A comparison of the heuristic algorithm with that of the neural network shows the former to be more robust. The approach proposed here, therefore for the combined problem, uses the neural network in conjunction with a heuristic method which enables different reconfiguration switches to be turned on/off and connected consumers to be switched between different phases to keep the phases balanced. An application example of the proposed method using real data is presented.},

abstract = {This paper presents a single-stage, three-phase grid connected solar photovoltaic (SPV) system. The proposed system is dual purpose, as it not only feeds extracted solar energy into the grid but it also helps in improving power quality in the distribution system. The presented system serves the purpose of maximum power point tracking (MPPT), feeding SPV energy to the grid, harmonics mitigation of loads connected at point of common coupling (PCC) and balancing the grid currents. The SPV system uses a three-phase voltage source converter (VSC) for performing all these functions. An improved linear sinusoidal tracer (ILST)-based control algorithm is proposed for control of VSC. In the proposed system, a variable dc link voltage is used for MPPT. An instantaneous compensation technique is used incorporating changes in PV power for fast dynamic response. The SPV system is first simulated in MATLAB along with Simulink and sim-power system toolboxes, and simulated results are verified experimentally. The proposed SPV system and its control algorithm are implemented in a three-phase distribution system for power quality improvement and improved utilization of VSC. The total harmonics distortions (THDs) of grid currents and PCC voltages are observed within IEEE-929 and IEEE-519 standards.},
