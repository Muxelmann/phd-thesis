\begin{abstract}

Electrification, as a result from ongoing decarbonisation of heat and transport sectors, is increasing the load on UK power distribution networks to a level where service disruptions are expected to occur more frequently.
Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) are anticipating this problem and have trialled deployment of Battery Energy Storage Solutions (BESS) for support of Low-Voltage networks.
This paper presents a dynamic control method that adjusts half-hourly BESS schedules at sub-half-hourly temporal resolution, managing day-ahead half-hourly peaks and sub-half-hourly volatility in demand.
Therefore, the proposed method overcomes drawbacks of traditional controls, which were either too inflexible to cater for today's volatile electricity demand, or which ran the risk of under- or overcharging the energy storage device, if their set-points were badly chosen.
The peak reduction performance of the proposed control method is demonstrated with the use of real sub-half-hourly demand profiles and their corresponding half-hourly load forecasts.
Results indicate additional 18.8\% peak reduction compared to traditional half-hourly BESS operation.
