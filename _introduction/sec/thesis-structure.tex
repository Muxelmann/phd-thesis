\section{Thesis structure}
\label{ch-introduction:sec:thesis-structure}

The structure of this thesis is organised as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	\textbf{Chapter \ref{ch-literature}} will carry out an extensive review of the literature surrounding the field in order to support the problem statement and proposed contribution.
	\item
	\textbf{Chapter \ref{ch1}} will develop a BESS scheduling mechanism and it will identify key network parameters that are used in corresponding cost functions to improve network operation.
	Then, this chapter address objective 1 by presenting a method that assigns a BESS schedule to the three-phase power distribution network whilst minimising the aforementioned cost functions; therefore improving network operation.
	Results are compared against a ``baseline'' and a ``normal'' (or traditional) operation case by assessing them on a temporal and probabilistic level.
	\item
	\textbf{Chapter \ref{ch2}} will extend the work in Chapter \ref{ch1} by presenting a dynamic control method that adjusts a half-hourly BESS schedule at sub-half-hourly temporal resolution in order to reduce both volatile and the daily load peak.
	Therefore, this chapter addresses objective 2.
	\item
	\textbf{Chapter \ref{ch3}} will address objective 3 by presenting a cooperative battery charging algorithm that is deployed on a Multi-Agent System and assessed in both a synchronised and desynchronised communications environment.
	In this chapter, both algorithm convergence and algorithm performance is compared between its implementation in the synchronised and desynchronised scenario.
	\item
	\textbf{Chapter \ref{ch4}} will develop a stochastic EV demand model that is based on real vehicle mobility behaviour, and it will develop a control algorithm for distributed BESS to mitigate the negative impact from those EV's demand.
	This chapter address objective 4, the final objective, by extending the Additive-Increase Multiplicative-Decrease algorithm to enable cooperating BESS operation under the absence of a shared communications infrastructure.
	\item
	\textbf{Chapter \ref{ch-conclusion}} will present a detailed conclusion that relates all findings back to the initial problem statement, and this chapter will present potential future work based on the findings from the research in this thesis.
\end{itemize}
