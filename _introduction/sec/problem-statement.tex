\section{Problem statement and research objectives}
\label{ch-introduction:sec:problem-statement}

The focus of the research presented in this thesis is put on aiding DNOs to manage and operate their power distribution networks by installing energy storage into the LV power distribution network.
More specifically, BESS is the main focus since it is a rapidly improving technology that has the potential to defer or even mitigate costly network reinforcements.
Modern battery technology allows the storage of electrical energy in ever-decreasing form factors, whilst power electronics technology becomes more efficient at integrating batteries into power networks.

As it will be shown in the literature review in Chapter \ref{ch-literature}, methods of controlling BESS to optimise power flow have been of great research interest.
However, merging both ``off-line'' and ``on-line'' to take advantage of both scheduled and real-time operation is still an open research challenge.
Subsequently, applying real-time corrections to BESS schedules in order to decrease peak demand whilst obeying to technical and operational constraints is also an identified research challenge.
Since the expected uptake of distributed LCTs and DERs through proliferation of household-connected storage solutions (e.g. to support PV integration or to counteract EV impacts) requires ``smart'' coordination mechanisms.
When requiring communication to implement this smart coordination, another challenge exists in developing algorithms that function despite communication disturbances (i.e. through message desynchronisation).
Lastly, in the case where communication-less coordination of distributed devices is sought, the challenge of assuring equal device usage whilst providing network support (e.g. to guarantee a minimum lifetime) has also been identified.

In accordance to the identified key challenges that motivate the conducted research, a set of objectives is presented in order to achieve the aim of contributing to the existing field:

	\item Develop a control mechanism for a single BESS to further improve three-phase network operation without deviating from its predetermined BESS schedule.
	\item Develop a control mechanism that dynamically adjusts BESS schedules to reducing load peaks by combining both off-line and on-line control.
	\item Develop and compare operation of a charge scheduling algorithm for multiple entities in a synchronised and desynchronised communications environment.
	\item Develop a control strategy for distributed BESSs by individually assigning control parameters to an extended charge-discharge-algorithm.
\end{enumerate}
