The aim of the work that is presented in this thesis is to make a contribution to the field of battery control algorithms.
To do so, particular focus is put on:

\begin{itemize}
	\item assigning predetermined battery schedules in such a way that they improve the operation of three-phase power distribution networks,
	\item correcting predetermined half-hourly battery schedules to address and mitigate load volatility at sub-half-hourly temporal resolution,
	\item assessing the effect of desynchronising distributed charging batteries that communicate using a multi-agent network, and
	\item optimising control parameters for distributed batteries in a communication-less environment to offset the negative impart of consumptive low-carbon technologies, i.e. electric vehicles.
\end{itemize}

This chapter presents the background and motivation for the conducted research.
Next, on the basis of the identified challenges and opportunities for battery energy storage in the electricity distribution network, the problem statement and all research objectives are outlined.
At the end of this chapter, all contributions and publications are stated, and the structure of the rest of this thesis is presented.
