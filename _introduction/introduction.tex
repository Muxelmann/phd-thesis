The aim of the work that is presented in this thesis is to make a contribution to the field of battery control algorithms.
To do so, particular focus is put on:

\begin{itemize}
	\item assigning predetermined battery schedules in such a way that they improve the operation of three-phase power distribution networks,
	\item correcting predetermined half-hourly battery schedules to address and mitigate load volatility at sub-half-hourly temporal resolution,
	\item assessing the effect of desynchronising distributed charging batteries that communicate using a multi-agent network, and
	\item optimising control parameters for distributed batteries in a communication-less environment to offset the negative impart of consumptive low-carbon technologies, i.e. electric vehicles.
\end{itemize}
