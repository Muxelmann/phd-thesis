\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch-introduction}

The aim of the work that is presented in this thesis is to make a contribution improving grid operation and reliance when using Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) in the UK Low-Voltage (LV) power distribution networks by adjusting sub-half-hourly operation and communication regimes of the BESS.
In this context, grid operation performance is considering mainly peak power flow, but also includes voltage deviation, phase imbalance, distribution losses, and the magnitude of neutral currents.

Providing grid support is expected to become a vital necessity since the predicted increase in electricity demand and demand volatility will negatively effect the performance of the UK distribution networks.
Due to the network's design and topology higher and more volatile demand is predicted to cause issues including voltage deviation, asset overloads, equipment damage and, in the worst case, service disruptions.
As discussed in this thesis, BESS is a suitable alternative to traditional network reinforcements.
However, to successfully combine fast system response capabilities (i.e. at sub-half-hourly resolution) with traditional operation schedules (i.e. at half-hourly resolution) to yield the best impact on network performance (e.g. peak-reduction) is still an open research question.
Also, with the proliferation of household-connected BESS and Electric Vehicles (EVs), performance of algorithms that coordinate BESS operation are an ongoing research topic, too.

In this chapter, Chapter~\ref{ch-introduction}, the background and motivation for the conducted research are presented.
Then, on the basis of the identified challenges and opportunities for battery energy storage in the electricity distribution network, the problem statement and all research objectives are outlined.
At the end of this chapter, all contributions and publications are summarised, and the structure of the rest of this thesis is presented.
